Even other parents stop me and either rave about how great they think it also is, or they want to know where I got it. My daughter started teething at three months, and while looking for things that would work for her teething I came across this style binky! Our main obstacle with such early teething was her not quite being able to grasp toys well enough to hold up to her mouth. This toy helped so much as it allowed her to hold onto one part of the toy and still be able to use the binky without having to hold onto a small binky itself and try to navigate. It is also easier to be able to hold her with a binky, I can have one free hand because the toy part of it allows the binky to stay in place. It makes a fun toy as well! She loves spying her binky and getting to play with it and feel the softness of the toy.",8/4/2015,1,1

Flexible? Rigid? Small? Or Big? I went through pages and reviews and got more confused. Some of them look fashion but I really worried about whether they are practical for me. After all, it is just a diaper bag.<br />I asked my friends whose baby girl is already 3 years old. She told me that you got to buy a diaper bag that is big enough especially when you have twin. That is the most important. Soon you will find it extremely helpful because there is never too many baby stuff to carry. She really have the point.<br />This bag is big and light enough for me. There are some points that I like about it.<br />-It doesn鈥檛 have too complex compartments inside which I like. It is easy for me to put things in and take out.<br />-The fabric inside is plastic which is easy to clean in case of bottle leakage. The material is good quality. It doesn鈥檛 have that kind of smell which is really not healthy for holding baby stuff.<br />-It has two side pocket and a large pocket for diaper. That is thoughtful because they are the thing you need handy such as diaper or bottle of milk. You need it immediately most of the time.<br />-It surprises me that it also has a transparent plastic bag. I use it to hold dirty or wet clothes. Very thoughtful.<br /><br />List of things I bring for a day out in case you need to know:<br />-A double stroller for my two children which our diaper bag can be easily attached.<br />-change of clothes<br />-diaper for two child.<br />-medicine like vitamins.<br />-paper handkerchief<br />-talc<br />-First aid kit<br />-pacifiers<br />-milk and two bottles.<br />-my wallet<br />-book.

Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep.<br /><br />With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine.<br /><br />I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth.<br /><br />FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.  So we only need one item to go out instead of a toy and pacifier.<br /><br />Other sleep suggestions:  From birth to about 2 months old, she just wasn't sleeping well at all, she constantly woke herself up when her arms would suddenly move - it startled her.  So with much trial and error, I found the solution to my baby sleeping all night: this swaddle sleepsack (her arms stopped waking her up), her monkey wubbanub pacifier (monkey keeps it in her mouth as she pops it in and out (most of the time), munchkin nursery projector/sound machine turned to heartbeat & projector, mattress at a slight angle (seemed to reduce reflux) = baby sleeping all night 6-10 hrs!!!!

What more could I say? This is my second Wubbanub purchase.I ordered one for DBG before she was born with hopes that she would take to it and she did!We have used our first one which was a small pink monkey now for nearly three months and it has been through a lot and still holding up.I wanted to have another as a back up.I ordered the ELLA BELLA Wubbanub because it was just too cute.We finally got it and I am very pleased with it.It is super soft and super cute.It is a good size not too small and not too big...just right and it's not heavy at all,just enough weight to it to help it stay where you want it to.I washed it and tried to give it to DBG and she would have nothing to do with it :( to my suprise.I decided to let her sleep with it for a few days along with her monkey Wubbanub and it worked! I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.<br />Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)",11/9/2012,1,1

He has 3: the giraffe, the monkey, and the puppy, but this is his favorite. We put them in his crib at night and if he wakes up crying, he finds one, puts it in his mouth, and goes back to sleep about 90% of the time completely on his own. He's been able to put them in his own mouth for a couple months now. In the morning, he wakes up and collects all three together and plays with them for about an hour which lets us sleep in, another huge plus :). If he's tired or fussy, his wubs soothe him right away. Because of the little animal attached, he doesn't lose or drop it very easily at all, and it gives him something to hold on to which is very comforting for him. He also loves it for teething now. I am very confident that learning to pick these up on his own and put them in his mouth has really increased his manual dexterity. They wash really easily in the washing machine and you don't even have to stick them in the dryer because they dry so fast. The only downside is if you have pets the hair may stick to the pacifier part, but we don't have this problem. Did I mention we get TONS of compliments on how cute they are? You really can't go wrong with these little guys!!! They are probably my favorite of all our baby items :).",12/4/2010,1,0

And of course our first one was free with our carseat and she chose that over expensive others I had purchased. So that has to say something.after having these binkys since April the green/yellow one developed mold on the inside. And the design on the outside has worn off. The upside is I emailed chicco and they have sent a replacement. The key to this is be very careful how you clean them. I recommend a binky sanitizing wipe and not immersing in water.

It is big enough to clean easily (bigger than Dr. BROWN's) and not too big to fit in my mugs when I warm the bottle.

He loves them all, but I wouldn't say equally. He has some he likes for bed, others for play, and a very few are loved so greatly they can do both. But this little bunny with her bright colors and fancy ears manages to be welcome in both his crib, or his stroller. Fancy that.<br /><br />This pacifier is the same amazing quality as all the others we've received. I'm sure &#34;Cora&#34; will be with us long after the pacifier has met it's end. I like the notion that giving up the pacifier when it's time will be a smoother transition since he can keep half of it. And really I think it's the half he loves most. We bought a mini pack in play and he doesn't like anything but his special wubanubs going in there. He puts them in, pets their back, and says &#34;Oh, babies&#34;. In fact the first time he said baby was when he was talking to his special friends, they're his babies. :)<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />After using this pacifier for a short while the decorative stitching on her face has started to come undone. Her nose has almost completely unraveled. I have never had the problem with wubbanubs but this is upsetting. There needs to be better quality control, this is a baby toy. I bought my son the pink bunny for his Easter basket and I'm going to have to really check it over before giving it to him. He was so sad when his purple one &#34;got hurt&#34; and I'm pretty mad he was distressed by something so avoidable.<br /><br />*SECOND UPDATE*<br />As I mentioned above we bought this in both pink and purple. While the pink seemed solid at first the stitching on her nose started to unravel as well. We own close to 30 of these and these two are only ones to have issues like this (we had a penguin that came with a ripped pacifier but that's a different issue). Clearly the quality of this particular style is lacking. To have both come apart in the exact same way is really disappointing. I've fixed both noses myself but I should never have had to do that.

Guess she never really caught onto the whole sucking thing) and would not accept any type of pacifier(like many parents we bought every pacifier on the market). That was until a friend told us they had a similar dilema and bought us a pack to try out. She absolutely loves them! They are perfect hold overs for until she really wants to eat.    These pacifiers are one piece and without the plastic guard. The advantage to this is that it reduces the chances of nasties lurking in the seams/cracks of where the plastic joins the nipple from improper washing or not sterilizing. Unless you are disassembling your childs two piece pacifier(plastic from nipple) and cleaning it, you're not cleaning it as well as your tell yourself.    Some  perhaps your child shouldn't be using them. These are NEWBORN PACIFIERS as stated on the package. If your child is not a NEWBORN then it's probably best to move onto other pacifiers more appropriately sized for your child. Everyone is different but I have a hard time believing a NEWBORN(as these are made for NEWBORNS) can swallow the entire pacifier. I've tried and had trouble myself.    Other complaints about the lack of 'bulbing' at the tip of the pacifier which makes it difficult for the newborn to hold in it's mouth is nothing more than laziness. Pay your child more attention. If your child is sucking her thumb(or mittens, sleeves, blankie, what have you) then she/he is  either hungry or wants comfort. If you're sticking a pacifier in a NEWBORNs mouth just so you don't have to listen to them cry, it's probably a good time to rethink your methods of raising a child. A pacifier is a great way to comfort or help increase her appetite(we used these to increase her appetite and get her in the habit of sucking so she would eat more) but should not be used simply as adistraction so you don't have to deal with them.     Lastly, people say these are ugly as sin. I agree, but your child doesn't care:) Just like all the decorations or excessive amount of money you can spend on newborn clothing, your child does not care.    If it works, it work. Every child is different.

Having a video feed, in addition to the audio, is wonderful.  This monitor does an adequate job of displaying a good angle of the room and is pretty clear even in the near dark.  In my opinion, the video doesn't have to be high definition, but simply good enough to give an idea of what your kid is doing.  This monitor does the job, and does it well.<br /><br />2. After about 11 months of use, the monitor would not take a charge.  Playing around with it, I determined that the wall charger was fine, but the battery would not recharge, or continue to work even when plugged in.  Even though we may have been out of warranty (we received the monitor as a gift well before the twins arrived), I called Motorola and they agreed to replace the monitor for free.  Much more than I expected from customer service.  So although it failed, Motorola was responsive and took care of the problem.  Since then, we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />3. The user interface isn't perfect.  For example, we have twins and purchased an extra camera for a second room.  While we love the ability to add extra cameras, and the possibility of setting the monitor to automatically cycle through the cameras, for some reason you cannot change the video feed while the volume or brightness control is on the display.  And there is a huge lag in the time it takes for the volume control to clear the screen after you hit the button.  Often, we'll hear one kid crying, pick up the monitor and turn up the sound, and then have to wait several seconds for that to clear before changing to a different video feed.  While this may seem like user error, or a small inconvenience, I'll be the first to admit that we aren't always thinking clearly at 2 a.m., which also happens to be the time when I have the least patience for the volume control to clear so I can change feeds.  This isn't a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.  It has additional features, like the ability to play music and speak through a microphone to the camera.  I've never used these other than to make my wife jump when she is putting away the kids' laundry.  It doesn't detract from the product, but seems unnecessary to me.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like the best monitor for the price.  Although I won't say it's perfect, I am happy we chose the MBP33 and have no regrets.'t a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.

Designed by a medical company, and made of hospital-grade silicone, the GumDrop is lightweight, very soft, and features a unibody construction, so there are no parts that can come loose. The shape of the pacifier allowed him (and all the other preemies in the NICU) to use it in the side-lying position, even with all his tubes (i.e. CPAP, nasal cannula, nasal gavage tube, etc.). You can put your finger in the open end, allowing you to easily control or hold the pacifier; it also allows you to feel how strong your baby's suck is. NNS (non-nutritive sucking) is very important for a baby's development, and our baby got to practice a lot of NNS with his GumDrop. It helped him to self-soothe himself as well when we couldn't be at his cribside.     Following his discharge, I have purchased two full-term mango colored pacifiers for his use. The company has since introduced full-term pink and blue colored pacifiers, but I would purchase the mango colour again. Overall, I highly recommend this product.

I have used this product since my son was just a few months old.  I loved it.  I never worried about the seat belt again.  I was in a car accident with my child when he was almost 3 years old.  I was still using this product with his forward facing car seat.  My car was totalled (I drove a Saturn)...the only part of the car without damage was the roof & the drivers side...my son's car seat was on the rear passenger side, so he recieved more of the impact than I did being the driver.  I honestly believe that this  product saved him from worse injuries than he recieved.  He came out of the wreck with only scratches on the top of his head.  Even though the Mighty-Tite makes the seat belt tight so that the car seat itself won't slide around, his car seat still fell over & that is what shielded his body & face from the glass.  I don't know how it worked out that way, but if his car seat hadn't fallen to its side, I think that he may have been hurt more.  The Mighty-Tite still worked fine after the wreck, & the seat belt never broke like some of the other reviews say.

We've tried a range of different kinds, shapes, and sizes. The Avant manages to keep him occupied the longest.<br /><br />There isn't a top or bottom, so you don't have to worry inserting it the wrong way, and they come in a range of kid-friendly colors, which helps with identifying which one to use (I don't know how many times I've asked my wife, Which one's the clean one? to which she'll reply, Use the blue one, the green one's dirty.).<br /><br />One minor annoyance, sudsy water can get trapped inside the nipple when you wash it. Rinsing it out is pretty easy, just pinch and release the nipple a few times while running it under the faucet. This seems to do the trick, even if you can't actually get in there and scrub it out.

It is natural rubber and I was told that it is latex free.  Being that my husband has many relatives with latex allergies, I don't want to expose my children to latex if I don't have to.<br /><br />I LOVE that this is a one piece design.  I know this sounds paranoid, but I can't help worrying about other pacifiers coming apart.  It's also very easy to clean and doesn't get gunk built up in it.  I also love that it's made from a natural material.  I know that the other pacifiers out there are free of BPA and all, but who's to say that there isn't something else in them that we'll later learn isn't healthy?  It's also nice to know that my baby can't shove these in her mouth.<br /><br />These also look very cute and retro.  The pacifiers I used as a baby back in 1980 look nearly identical.  They may not suit everyone's taste, however.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the largest size (12 month+) has a very large bulb at the end.  I guess the best reference I can think of is that it was quite a bit larger than those round Gerber binkies.  I tried the largest size when my baby was 18 months and she rejected it immediately.  (I've tried offering it to her a few times and she just chews on it a bit and tosses it aside.)  Maybe my children are just on the sensitive side, but I can't imagine that any of them would have accepted it.

Once she knew she could do it, bedtime became a nightmare.  I didn't think she was mature enough to stay in a toddler bed.  And I was having a terrible time sleeping myself worrying that she would get out of her crib and would have free rein in the house.  I was concerned by some of the reviews saying it was poorly constructed, but I was desperate.  I have to say I love it!  My daughter things it's great when I put her in it, she'll even lift the flap for me to zip it sometimes.  She fusses when it's time to lay down.  But that's the same with the tent or without.  She seems to fall asleep more quickly with the tent.  I'm guessing that's partly because she can't throw her comfort items (blanket, lovey and seahorse) out, and partly because she knows she really doesn't have another option.  Instead of trying to get out of the crib, she just lays down.  I will agree the instructions could be better.  It took me longer than I would have liked to put it together. As for those with the zipper troubles, I almost wonder if they had the velcro too tight.  I know the first couple of times I zipped and unzipped it, I was really concerned. (It was like zipping up luggage that was too full.) But when I loosened the velcro holding it to the front rail, the zipper action was much smoother.  I have only had it for 6 weeks.  So I can not speak to it's long term durability.  But so far I am pleased.  The biggest cons I have with this crib tent would be that the zipper is loud.  I usually take out her musical seahorse, and cover her up before I go to bed.  I try to be as quiet as I can, but it sometimes makes her stir.  Thankfully it hasn't woken her up yet.  The other con is using it with a video baby monitor. The mesh makes it hard for the monitor camera to see in the crib.  I had to move the camera several times before finding somewhere that gave me a reasonable view.  For us, the pros of this product far outweigh the cons. Sleep is a precious commodity at our house. It was worth every penny we paid for this crib tent for her to get better sleep, thereby allowing me to get better sleep.",12/4/2011,1,0

They have flaws such as the cleaning hassle and the brand is in the works of making some for older babies (these are only meant for 0-6). Which sucks bc my daughter is 6m. At least they are trying. But what made me give this 3 stars is not bc of these reasons. i would still give it a 5. The pros totally out wight the cons. but why this particular one earned 3 stars is bc when received it had cotton sticking out of the stitches. It had a huge knot of thread where it was sew shut. The tail had no filling. JUst a long piece of cloth. THe whole monkey felt less filled then her kitty that she has. Other then that its works great. I was just upset about the quality.

First, a lactation consultant said that these straight-nipple pacifiers are better for breast-feeding babies (or if you are trying to get your baby to breastfeed).  Second, she was given this brand of pacifier (the soothie, no stuffed animal attached) in the hospital and she preferred it to the Nuk pacis.  I tried my hardest for the first 5 weeks to get her to like the Nuk because I bought 3 packages but she loved the soothie from the hospital.  I saw these and noticed they used soothie and figured I'd try it.  She loved it right away.  She could hold it and it stayed in a little better than Nuk.  I will continue to buy these because she plays with them even when she is not putting the pacifier part in her mouth.

We started my baby on the soothie but he never could keep it in his mouth.  After experimenting with a cheap-o luvs orthodontic pacifier I decided the orthodontic shape would work much better.      First off, the rubber discolored when I sterilized it.  I don't know if that makes a difference, but it came out with a white tinge to it.  He took it right away and the shaped nipple helped keep it in but because the shield hits his nose, it still falls out easily.  The shields that are shaped to the face seem to help him keep it in more easily.  Another flaw is that the loop sticks out from his face, and since my son grabs at everything he can, he keeps pulling it out of his mouth.      Maybe if he wasn't in such a grabby stage or was more able to keep it in his mouth I would have liked it better.  We ended up getting a MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] and he loves it.

My son took it and it certainly helped in those early days where he wanted to suck 24-7.  He never could keep it in his mouth though which I chalked up to being so little and perhaps not convinced that he loved the pacifier.  I wasn't convinced I wanted him to love it so that was OK.     Then at 1 month he would scream whenever we gave it to him so we quit.  At 3 months though he started sucking on everything and we broke out the pacifier again.  He could hold it in his mouth for a little while but without careful attention it gets pushed out.  Now at 3.5 months we need a pacifier so that my husband might have a chance of putting the baby to bed when I'm not here to nurse him down.  The soothie falls out so fast that there is no chance it could work to do anything but comfort him when he is really upset.      With some experimentation we have discovered that he needs   a) the shield that is molded to the face.  The soothie shield (and the natursutten [[ASIN:B001AVNK6E Natursutten All-Natural Rubber Orthodontic Pacifier, 0-6 months]] that we tried) bumps up against his nose and gravity makes it more likely to fall out.    b) a more shaped nipple.  The orthodontic ones work but so does the MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] nipple (which is shaped like a bulb but theoretically compresses to an orthodontic shape, though it doesn't really when I tried it. )  The bulb shape of the MAM seems to be enough to keep it behind his gums which seems to help it stay in too.    We just tried out the MAM and he kept it in his mouth for 30 minutes before pushing it out with his tongue (while playing)!  It also has no top/bottom like the soothie so it is easier to get in his mouth in the dark.    Pacifiers are cheap (except for the Natursutten) so it isn't a big deal to try a few different ones--just because one baby does well with one doesn't mean another one will or won't.  But for us, the MAM worked much better.  I'm wondering if we should have tried it earlier--perhaps it would have been helpful in those fussy early months where he wouldn't take the soothie.",8/10/2009,-1,1

We bought small packs of three different types of pacifiers to see what our baby would prefer.  We bought Dr Brown's Prevent, Nuk, and Avent.  Our baby will LOVES the Dr Brown pacifiers.  She'll put up with the Avent ones, but they pop out of her mouth so easily it's hardly worth it.  The Nuk ones get spit out almost instantly, they're too hard to keep in her mouth.  These ones have a fantastic shape that is very well designed.  I love that it doesn't give her gas because she's not sucking any air.  These are just so perfectly designed and we've already bought more for her.  I think it's good advice to try different pacifiers for your baby because all babies are different, but I will say that these ones definitely stay in their mouths better no matter who your baby is - so I won't tell you not to try different pacifiers at first, but definitely include these when you're trying a few out!  They'll probably become a quick favorite for you and baby.<br /><br />Originally we purchased the Dr Browns Prevent pacifiers from another Amazon listing where Colors may vary and there are no handles on the pacifier.  We ended up with blue and red, which I didn't love for our little girl.  It's silly and not important, but I didn't love having her suck on a blue or red pacifier when she was always dressed in pink or purple.  These pacifiers are much preferred!  Though they're the same shape for sucking, there are a few differences.  The silly difference (but it matters to me!) of the color is the obvious difference.  Another key difference is these ones also have the handles on them and the others don't.  I have found that I much prefer the handles for multiple reasons.  One, they are easy to hold if I'm burping her and just want to have the pacifier handy for when she's done and ready for it.  Two, if I drop the pacifier, the extra weight from the handle makes it land on the back almost every time so the nipple doesn't get dirty.  Three, if you're attaching a pacifier clip, it can attach to the handle instead of the opening on the part of the pacifier that touches the baby's face.  Our pacifier clip was always rubbing against our baby's face when using the other ones and I didn't like that since it left a red mark on her cheek.<br />Another difference is that these pacifiers actually come with a clip-on nipple cover.  I LOVE this accessory because if I'm running to a neighbor's house for a short visit and I don't need to tote a whole diaper bag, but I do want to bring a pacifier - I easily can with the clip cover.  It works so great to just clip the cover on so I can throw the pacifier in my pocket without it getting all nasty.  Or it's nice for putting in the diaper bag without getting gross as well.<br /><br />The price is about the same (within a dollar) of the other colors may vary listing, so these ones are the clear winner between the two listings.  If you want a great pacifier for your little girl, these are PERFECT!",4/9/2013,1,0

I originally got the elephant and the giraffe as baby gifts when my son was first born. We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall/get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have:<br />1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier.<br />2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite.<br />3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red/blue/orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute.<br />4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time.<br />5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more.",8/15/2014,1,0

And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.<br /><br />However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:<br />- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.<br />- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.<br />- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!<br /><br />Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby.

I believe it's the softness and shape of the paci that makes it feel like the breast. My baby cries for the paci as soon as he feels full from the breast, that's how much he loves sucking it. It's also a great chew toy for him, when he's not soothing, he likes to take out the paci and chew all around it, the round flap, the ring at the back. Guess the bouncy rubber is so fun to chew on. I wish they would make actual chew toy out of the same material!  I bought two 5 months ago so that I can have a spare, and baby has been using them this whole time. The paci did turn brown, and gets sticky as soon as it dries up, but rinse it in a little water when it sticks and its good to suck on again. That's why I would recommend anyone to buy a couple at least to switch around if one gets dirty/sticky. But there's really no need to replace them just because of this.

They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care.<br />They were not so professional what so ever.<br /><br />We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping.<br /><br />Would still recommend the product though.

But my 4 month old loves the bright colors of it. He has also started playing with the duck and the sheep now that he's getting older and discovering textures more and more. Like my review of the sheep I would say besides the odd positioning of the pacifier due to the beak, my only other grievance is that the pacifiers aren't removable.

I tried 2 others and she wouldn't have them at all. I tried to go without one at all but that wasn't an option with her. She has a very strong urge to suck to soothe. Since she's breastfed too, that meant that I was nursing her for 2/3+ of the day.

I thought I'd like it better because it was all pink and cute but wanted to have a 2nd as a backup/ rotation. But, once I got the pink one in I really did not like it. It's not as floppy or long as this giraffe, which makes all the difference.

She's getting pretty good at it, considering she really don't have much hand eye coordination. She can shove the giraffe's head around with her hands and root around until she gets it back in her mouth. The other one just falls away if she quits sucking.<br />I wanted 2 to have to rotate through and to have a backup.

Not only that, but when he was so young he could start holding it and directing it back into his mouth or pick it up.  Now that he is just over one, it is his lovey, he likes to have it with him when he is ready for a nap or needs comfort.

One of the best parts about this pacifier is that I do not have to attach it to a string pacifier holder (which could get wrapped around my little one), I would simply just rest it on him and he would push at it if he wanted it.  This sweet little animal is light weight yet heavy enough to stay put in a carseat or while he sleeps in his bassinet.  This product is great, I have had it for my child since he was born, I gave it to him about 4-5 days in as a newborn (which I have come to realize is the best time to give a pacifier to a newborn, it is not too early for nipple confusion and not too late that they refuse it).  He has been able to grasp at it from day one.  He was able to push the little animal back in if it started to fall out or push it out if he did not want it.  The design makes it easier to stay in their mouths when they are so little and are learning to suck.     It is also easy to wash and it drys quickly.  I recommend two so that you can always have one ready to go.    I did see a few other wubbanub pacifiers on sale at Babies'R'us, but when my friend purchased hers I noticed that the quality was not as good, they were much more flimsy and very light weight, making it hard to stay put.   When I was still pregnant I wrote...I love this product, it is so precious and this is the best price I have seen for these.  My friends baby has them and loves them so much, she is able to grab it at put it back in her mouth herself.  I am still pregnant and hoping that my baby will love them as much as my friends baby did.  I love how soft they are and they are a good size, not too large and not too small.

I just zip it inside a boppy slipcover before putting it in the wash so it doesn't get beat up by the machine.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for any parent who is frustrated when their baby's soothie keeps falling out of their mouth. Not only did it help our daughter keep it in her mouth, it gave her something to bond with as she falls asleep or needs comfort.",11/11/2011,1,0

He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did!<br /><br />When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own!<br /><br />UPDATED JULY 2013<br /><br />I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm.",5/14/2013,1,1

It minorly interferes with breastfeeding; if my baby suckles on this a long time, she'll chew on my nipple a couple times before latching like normal, so wait to introduce this until the baby is a pro at latching.

(not recommended).  i am not saying this to discourage you to buy this seat, rather i think you should educate yourself on how to put an infant into a car seat well in advance of the day you decide to take the baby home from the hospital!!!  since then, obviously we figured it out. and now we love this carseat.<br /><br />i own both the boulevard cs 70 and the marathon versions of the britax seats.  the boulevard is considerably more &#34;luxe&#34; than the marathon. i like that the seatbelt clicks. at first, i hated it because i felt like it was way too constricting when it squeezed against my baby. but now i feel like i need that comfort of the click to know the seat belt is on properly.  the marathon that i have does not have the click feature, and i never feel like it's on tight enough.<br /><br />we decided to not go with the infant carrier seat, and i am very happy with my decision to not get one (despite a lot of protests from my friends).  a few words of advice for those of you choosing to use only one convertible car seat from birth until they outgrow the seat...<br /><br />1.) newborns need a full recline! otherwise their heads roll forward and can constrict breathing.  we had to get towels and prop the seat up so that the seat would fully recline properly in our car<br /><br />2.) when the seat is rear facing, and in newborn recline mode, it may not fit in your car right. especially if you are tall people that require the driver seat and passenger seats pushed all of the way back.  my husband is 6'4&#34;.  this is a problem for us, because the seat couldn't recline completely and thus, the baby's neck was constricted.  we actually bought a new car all because of this!!! not exactly the most economical approach, but we wanted a new car anyhow.<br /><br />3.) the cushions are essential to get with your convertible car seat so that you can properly get a ball of a newborn baby to fit into the seat right.<br /><br />4.) i highly recommend getting one of those inserts that wraps around the baby's head so that the head doesn't fall from side to side.  that was a huge problem for me at first because of the lack of neck and head control in those first months.<br /><br />5.) if you are in a bumpy ride (think a jeep wrangler, or a sporty subaru impreza with stiff shocks), then don't get a seat like this for a newborn. their head is going to bounce all over the place in the car seat.<br /><br />6.) it takes some practice to maneuver the newborn into the car seat because of the lack of head control.  you have to sort of hold the baby horizontal, and slide them into the car seat sideways. it's annoying but possible.<br /><br />overall, it's possible to do this from birth on, but there are definitely considerations that need to be made when making that choice!",11/7/2013,0,1

The soothie and gumdrop pacifiers are the only ones recommended by lactation professionals for nursing babies, so I feel like if you have to use one of the soothies, why not have a cute one?  To wash the dragon, I've just used a damp cloth with some dish detergent and let him air dry.  It has worn just fine cleaning him with this method.  Just a reminder, the soothie is stitched to the dragon, so you cannot change out the pacifier, unless you feel comfortable sewing and are crafty.

I thought they were just stuffed animals attached to pacifiers.  I didn't realize I needed one until I was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier.  Quickly, I ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier.  It took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and I immediately cleaned it and put it to use.  It works great.  My two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired (despite my best efforts for naps) to help her settle down.  I haven't used it in the car yet, which is where I need it most, but I'm sure it'll be great.  It's nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort.<br /><br />The only downfall I see with the design of the product is that you can't take the paci off to really clean it.  Yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and I did that.  I just wish I could run it through my dishwasher like I do the other things to make sure it's really sterilized.  But, then I'm kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one.  Definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter's tiny hands can really grab onto it.  She seems to like the soft feel.  The little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing.

The pacifier is softer than the regular NUK and is shaped in a way that leaves more space for the tongue. It is also very light and has two slits on the sides to allow more air flow. Yes, it's true that the baby can fit the whole thing in his mouth (my son did it once when he was about 5 months old) but there is absolutely no way that he would be able to swallow it. Plus the slits on the sides would not allow him to suffocate either (the air or saliva can still flow freely). The baby can get a little scared if it got stuck in his mouth but that's about it. And by the way, many other pacifiers out there would fit in baby's mouth as well, so there is no reason to deem this one more dangerous than others.

Those clips are nice, but surely get lost in the laundry!  Wish I had thought of this a long time ago!  For 5 months we began with 2  WubbaNubs and remain with the same 2 !

We tried several types/brands before these and my daughter likes these the best by far.<br /><br />Advantages over others:<br />I really wanted to use the avent soothies but they just wouldn't stay in my daughters mouth. They bumped her nose and in general just looked too large and slightly uncomfortable.<br /><br />I also tried other nuk pacifiers. What I liked about them was the shape. The heart shaped shield seemed to fit better and just looked more comfortable. The shape of the pacifier nipple was shorter and the shape seemed easier and more enjoyable for my daughter to keep in her mouth. She loved it but it wasn't my favorite because it couldn't be sterilized and water would get trapped in the nipple. It just didn't seem as hygienic as I would have liked.<br /><br />Then I found these. The orthostar pacifiers are the best. They are all one silicone piece, similar to the avent pacifiers. They can be sterilized and there is no way for water to get trapped anywhere.

Obviously I paid way more at the specialty store where I bought it. I have now chosen this set for my baby girl due in June. The most awesome thing about her sets is the 4 pc. slipcovered bumpers. I have looked everywhere and cannot find any other manufacturer who offers this. So the colors aren't EXACTLY what I was hoping for--so what! You need to think more about the functionality of your choices for baby's nursery more than the cosmetics, especially with more than one child. You may not appreciate it until your baby has their first bout with a stomach virus--some of you know what I mean! It is so convenient to be able to unzip the slipcovers off the bumper and throw them in the washer & dryer without ruining your entire crib bumper. It's also great if you need to wash only one section. Also, when your child gets too tall for a bumper, you can simply remove the section(s) where they could use it to climb out. My son is huge for 15 mos. and loves to use the 3 sections of the bumper still in his crib as pillows to lay on. The quality is excellent and this set will outlast the time your child is in the crib. If you don't like the feel of the sheet, go out and buy some extra sheets that coordinate with the set (that's what I did the first time). I feel there is no better choice than Wendy B. and we're lucky they're readily available at BRU vs. paying boutique pricing!",4/7/2005,1,1

Same pacifier given to babies in the hospital!","My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth.  I frantically purchased several look-a-likes when we came home.  Even at the her tender age of just a few months old, she was not to be fooled by these silly knock-offs.  I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved!<br /><br />During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well.<br /><br />First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier.<br /><br />Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify.<br />There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",8/30/2012,1,1

Also, other pacifiers are shaped too similarly to her milk bottles and she gets mad that milk doesn't come out of them. I also wasn't thrilled that you had to wash the paci with the toy. So being a crafty mom, i knew i could fix this so she would like it. I got it in the mail yesterday and as i predicted she just spit it out. so i took my seam ripper and got the pacifier off easily without hurting the toy. then i took one of the holders for the nam which come apart and there is a hole at the end where the tie for the clip goes through - it was the perfect size for the hole i had made. a few stitches and viola! popped the pacifier in the holder (i also like that it can spin around in the holder) and we were good to go. she had been crying for about 15 mins, i put it in her mouth, showed her how she could grab on to it and she was sleeping within minutes. she has fallen asleep with it 4 times since then. so, like i said - i loved the idea of this product but had to make it work for me. just an idea for some of you other crafty moms (or dads) out there ;)",3/11/2011,1,0

(it helps to have some cargo in the front, for balance.)<br /><br />鈥?it is undeniably handsome. i probably wouldn't have chosen the bright yellow if there had been more options, but it is cheerful and easy to look at. it is also easy to see, which makes it safer.<br /><br />鈥?it is vented. most of the time, we keep the bug screen and window open and stowed, so ventilation isn't much of an issue, but in rain or cooler weather, the vent underthe handle is terrific. to keep airflow going, i zip the window down on both sides, but tuck the bottom inch or two up next to the screen.<br /><br />cons:<br /><br />鈥?soft seat means with two riders, they'll squish toward the middle. it's easy to fix by adding something rigid underneath. when his buddy comes along, that's what we do, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />鈥?the back of a bike helmet pushes the child's head forward, which must be uncomfortable. i got no complaint from my little guy, but i'm thinking of a way to fix it, because it bugs me.<br /><br />鈥?while i wouldn't call it heavy, i've seen other bike trailers out there that are tiny and look featherlight. anyone who spends much time on a bike knows how much weight matters. it's easy enough to haul around, but its features and size mean that it's no fun coming across  a stop sign when you're starting up a hill with two kids in the trailer.<br /><br />all in all, this is a superb piece of equipment.",8/17/2013,-1,1

We were looking for something light weight that would stay in the baby's mouth, as opposed to the gumdrops which we were forever putting back in. We bought the 3m+, so have been using it for almost 2months.<br /><br />Pros: lightweight, baby loves it, easy to clip onto the clips that have the loops on the end. Baby has also been able to get the Paci back in her own mouth because it is so light weight. Te gumdrops would pop out so fast.<br /><br /> Cons: it is easy to get shoved up closer to the nose (as earlier reviewer said) but it hasn't been a terrible problem, since we are always with her. Also, the comments you will get about the look of the Paci will be endless, since this is a newer Paci and it's not mainstream yet. (Not really a con...just be prepared to explain to people!). It doesn't fit like a normal Paci: It doesn't really touch her face, so she does have to suck continuously. This hasn't seemed to bother the baby too much.<br /><br />Overall, we are pleasantly surprised with this new find. I thought it would be a difficult transition from the gumdrops....but so far so good. We found ours at Target, but am going to order the 6m+ very soon from here.",4/15/2015,1,0

I love how soft the elephant is. I was also very happy that for the first time in her two months of being on Earth she decided she didn't need the vanilla scent of her soothies from the hospital. We will now be ordering her the Red Dragon, as that was the one my husband wanted to get her.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because of the way it has to be cleaned, and the binkies are not interchangeable if the soothie gets worn down.

11949,us,32080670,r3rse7ve043cnl,b000wjncx6,337883289,graco lovin hug easy entry open top curved frame swing,baby,5,49,51,n,n,love this swing,"i bought a second hand swing at a thrift store and used it every day for about a month before the motor died; our baby loves to swing for naps and when i'm showering, cooking or otherwise can't hold her.  i immediately began researching for a new swing and ordered this one sunday night.  the swing arrived the following friday afternoon. she and we love this swing!       our baby is 12 lbs, 24 inches, 11 weeks old.  the seat is deep so we have to put a little pillow in the bottom for her to sit on, otherwise she slides forward and is too slumped to be comfortable.  i'm glad the swing is deep because she'll be able to use it as she grows.  i've read reviews that said the tray is hard to open and makes a loud noise; i find the tray easy to open with one hand and it's very quiet if you're careful.  if you're in a hurry it does make a snapping sound as it clicks into place.  we ditched the mobile because it interferes with the swinging arm (as someone else noted in his review) and the toys are directly over the baby's head where she can't see them anyway.  will have to think of a solution when baby really starts noticing toys.    the swing has 6 settings; we use the high setting to calm her and help her get to sleep as recommended by dr.karp in \\happiest baby on the block\\, then put the swing on a low setting while she sleeps.  the swing has a timer option but if you don't use the timer, it doesn't automatically shut off as other swings do. we like that it works continuously since she sleeps in the swing at night (right beside my side of the bed where i hear her every sniff and sigh). she was sleeping five hours at a time in her co-sleeper but in the swing she sleeps up to 12 hours with one night-time feeding.       i feel comfortable letting her sleep in the swing since we swaddle her tightly (also rec. by karp) and the swing is deep as noted above.  we don't use the complicated 5 point straps since we swaddle her and use the tray for restraint.  even when she isn't swaddled we feel safe leaving her unstrapped (with an adult monitoring in the same room) and she is very active--always kicking and flailing her arms while awake.  she can't turn herself over yet though, so we may have to use the straps later.  another reason we feel safe letting her sleep in the swing is that even with poor neck strength at this age, her head doesn't flop forward even on the highest setting.  i haven't had to adjust the swing back so can't comment on that; when we first put it together she reclined nicely in it.     i'm thrilled so far with the battery life.  we've been using the swing every day and night for nine days now; we frequently use the high setting and the batteries show no sign of slowing.    others have commented that the music is boring and \\nature sounds\\ are horrible.  they are.  we don't use the music since she doesn't seem to care about it and we'd be better off turning on a cd of classical music instead.  we don't use the nature sounds either since we use a floor fan for white noise that she likes, but in defense of graco (whether they planned this or not) karp points out that babies love white noise which is what the \\nature sounds\\ sound like.  white noise is similar to what baby hears in the womb--a loud shhhhhh as blood rushes through mother's circulatory system.     the swing is very quiet even on the high setting; as i said she sleeps in it beside me and i'm a light sleeper.      while the swing is bulky, i'm still able to pick it up and move it daily from bedroom to living room to kitchen without too much trouble.  it's bulky but not heavy.  the legs do fold for storage.    so the cons for us---mobile is useless, have to push \\off\\ button up to six times to get the swing to stop swinging, straps are laughably complicated---maybe to prevent older children from removing baby before mom has a chance to notice??  maybe to prevent lawsuits??        pros for us---deep, large, comfy seat; weight limit 30lbs instead of more common 25lbs; removable head immobilizer; quiet, easy to open tray; quiet motor; great speed settings; sturdy frame; fairly easy to move around house; no automatic shut off; long battery life with frequent swing use; removable, washable swing cover; easy to put together (30 minutes tops); reliable name brand; price is great esp. with free super saver shipping; and of course the baby loves this swing!     if the swing ends up having a short lifetime, i'll update my review.",8/9/2008,1,0

 i would give them 6 or 7 stars.<br /><br />they combine all of the good features of the other brands into one product, with none of the flaws that the other products have.<br /><br />i love these bags!<br /><br />okay, so here's the low down on these:<br /><br />- this is the new version of honeysuckle's breastmilk bags, which are designed to be used with a pump--you just pump right into them.<br /><br />the bags have little holes on the top part, so that you can attach them to a pump adapter.  so, for the full experience, you need a pump adapter or two, which you can get by purchasing a pack of bags made by your pump's manufacturer.  i bought these medela bags: [[asin:b007pexokw medela pump & save breastmilk bags with easy-connect adapter - 50 ct]] because i have a medela pump.  i don't know if adapters are interchangeable between brands.  then, use the medela bags if you want, so that you're not wasting, and so that you know how wonderful these honeysuckle bags are when you start using them.  whether or not you use the bags, keep the little plastic adapters.<br /><br />then get some of these honeysuckle breast pump bags, and you'll see how perfect they are.<br /><br />medela vs. honeysuckle<br />all right, so here are the reasons that i like this bag better than the medela bags:<br />1. the plastic is not as rigid as the medela bags, yet it is still thick enough that you don't have to worry about it.<br />2. get this: the honeysuckle bags fit the medela easy adapter better than the medela bags do!  with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!

With the small animal attached to the pacifier it made it easy for her to search for it in the middle of the night without the assitance of my husband or I.  Then around the age of 2, the pacifier actually broke off of the stuffed animal due to wear & tear (my kid would hold onto the pacifier with her teeth and pull it out of her mouth constantly).

As a last ditch effort I decided to try pumping, but my little one refused to take the medela bottles we had. I found this set at Walmart in white and figured it was worth a try since my son takes the MAM paci. He took the bottle instantly and I've loved them since. Here is my breakdown of pros and cons<br />PROS: - the vented bottle does help with gas, its like I have a whole new baby and we are getting to enjoy the smiles that we love to see! Note: he still has gas but there is a marked change in how he handles it grunts vs. Crying and screaming<br />- the nipple shape is easy for him to use and doesn't seem to bother him switching from the bottle to me when I want him to nurse.<br />-the sterilization feature is awesome! I didn't want to buy one of those bulky sterilizers and I'm busy enough as it is with my family and baby, so 3 minutes in the microwave and done!<br />- super easy to clean! These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything<br />- they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top! I found these much more user friendly than other anti-colic bottles. Even my beloved Born Free that I used for my first son can't stand up to the MAM.<br />-did I mention they have helped the gas issue?  Because that's the most important part for me :)<br />-I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it.<br />- I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these. Besides the wide bottom doesn't fit in some warmers.<br />-the numbers aren't the easiest to read especially if you care about anything less than 2 ounces.  For me, this hasn't been an issue to cause much concern.<br /><br />Overall I love the bottles, they are cute and more functional than I could hope!

I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.<br /><br />Here's what we like:<br /> - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.<br /> - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!<br /> - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).<br /> - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.<br /><br />Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.<br /><br />The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!! We've bought 5 packs over a couple of months and received: 3 red/blue, 1 green/teal, and 1 pink/purple. I'll likely save the pink/purple for a gift- or in case or pacifier emergency!",1/11/2014,1,1

I've since purchased two more for when my son drops his in gross places and they need to go through the washing machine. In between washes in the washing machine I wash only the pacifier part and it's not too difficult. Once in a while the tip of the giraffe's nose gets wet but that's not a big deal and it dries quickly.<br /><br />I should mention that I've seen other WubbaNubs and knockoff WubbaNubs and so far the giraffe is my son's very favorite. It's longer than the others and narrower and more easily stays on his chest. Now that he's 7 months old that's not important because he can keep the pacifier in his mouth and he can also put it back in his mouth if it falls out. But when he was smaller it was just the perfect size to sit and stay on his chest. He also loved holding the giraffes ears. When he first learned to grab at things he'd grab the giraffes ears happily and by default would hold the pacifier in his mouth better as he was falling asleep.<br />I only add these things because choosing which adorable stuffed animal part was difficult but I had to keep getting the giraffe because of those reasons!<br /><br />One more reason to get this is that once babies can reach for things and put things in their mouth these are even more amazing. My son drops his and can easily find it and put it back in his mouth. He also loves to play with it as a toy!

(maybe not only as a baby monitor). lastly, it had the vox feature that i didn't know too much about but it got me interested. it said something about noise cancellation and i wondered how that would work. lastly, i was very excited about the ptz feature on the cameras.<br /><br />as for design, i believe samsung's monitor looks sleek and elegant. the black on white really makes the monitor look like a quality product. the overall design of the camera, the color, and shape of the monitor is sharp, and the four way directional button to control the camera is very convenient and easy to use.<br />why i decided to go with samsung: i purchased the sew-3037 because of three reasons.  as a company, i trust samsung. they know how to make electronic products. i love their tv and i love their phones. i figured, they'd do a great job on this as well. secondly, the overall image quality, the ptz feature, and the vox feature. lastly, the monitor being expandable to four camera system.<br /><br />after receiving the monitor: i love it. i tested it for a couple of days and i can't stop playing with it. the overall video and audio quality on the camera is very good. the range hasn't given us any problems and we have a pretty sizeable house. i don't believe it's available now, but i definitely plan to purchase more cameras. the vox is a great feature. it saves battery so you get a good couple of hours on the monitor. it also keeps things quietly and goes into sleepmode when my daughter isn't making any noise for a minute or two. then it comes alive again if she stirs. you can set the sensitivity and also turn it off all together.<br /><br />the feel of the cameras and the monitor is solid, not flimsy at all. the color and design is as i thought, very sleek. i love the look of the camera. i'm thinking i'm going to find other uses for it even after my daughter gets older. i think this was a great buy and definitely will recommend it to my friends.",11/17/2012,1,0

She is 3 months and she is able to grab onto the stuffed kitten and put the paci back in her mouth - a task she hasn't quite mastered yet with her traditional pacifiers. She was also able to grab onto the stuffed part from a pretty early age. When she was a newborn, I was able to swaddle in her Wubba so that she didn't &#34;lose it.&#34;<br /><br />The pacifier part of the Wubba is an Avent Soothie, which is approved for use with babies under 6 months. I love that the WubbaNub collection uses a well known and respected pacifier manufacturer, since that is the part that goes in my child's mouth. The stuffed animal part is similar to a beanie baby. It is very soft, not too big, and not too heavy - perfect for an infant to handle.<br /><br />It is also important to note that the Wubba's wash nicely. We have the Tabby Kitten, Giraffe, and Red Dog and all of them have been in the wash several times by now. They come out nice and clean and looking like new. I am sure that as my child grows and is more mobile that they will see heavier use and show some signs of aging, but so far I am very please with the quality on this item and it is used daily.<br /><br />My daughter loves them so much that I know I will not only be buying more of them for her, but I will also be giving these to my expecting friends.",12/5/2014,1,0

I'd read a lot about Wubbanubs and Soothies (the pacifier brand attached to the Wubbanubs) being a great option for holding.<br /><br />LOVE Wubbanubs! Took a few days/weeks for little one to warm up to using a pacifier but she loves her Wubbanubs. I bought the tabby kitty to keep in her crib and we use the ducky for going out. The necks are easy to use a snap-on pacifier holder ( a friend had gotten us one from Etsy with a thick hairband on the end). They're super easy to grasp for little one. It was the first thing she learned to really grab well and to pull back into her mouth.<br /><br />They sit so well on her chest. I like the kitten over the ducky for this reason-  it's a bit wider so it sits really well. And I just realized I can (LOOSELY) tuck it into her swaddle so that it's easy to find again. I just did it for the first time and little one has been starting to go through a sleep regression and she just woke up, found it, and went back to sleep! Holy crap. Why didn't I try this sooner?!<br /><br />Anyways, I've tried regular pacifiers (even Soothies) since and she spits them right out. She liked to hold on to the little stuffed guys. I definitely recommend and I think I'm going to start getting them for baby shower presents, since you probably can't have too many.<br /><br />I will say, I wish I could take off the paci to boil but I wash it with hot water and soap every once in a while and throw it through the wash occasionally (especially the one we take out of the house).

Before we found that our daughter prefers the GumDrop, we tried the following pacifiers (because we received a ton at my baby showers):   1) Philips Avent Soothie Pacifier - look similar to GumDrop, but doesn't have the nook cutout around the nose  2) NUK latex pacifier and the Nuk silicone - have the angled tip upwards  3) various MAM pacifiers - shorter oval sized stem and silicone  4) Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier - angled tip upwards    Our daughter preferred silicone to latex and wasn't picky at first, but once she hit 6 months, she wouldn't take any of the others than her GumDrop!  We don't give out 5 stars easily unless we really love something, but these GumDrop pacifiers are the best.  One thing to note - I wasn't sure what the difference was between the newborn vs. full-term GumDrop pacifier - newborn was what we received in the hospital on the package but it said full-term on the ones we ordered here on Amazon.  From what we can tell, we believe the only difference is the thickness/consistency of the silicone.  The newborn ones appear to be a little thinner/softer type of silicone and the full-term ones are a little thicker/sturdier perhaps since they chew harder especially now that there are teeth!  There is no difference in the length of the stem or the overall shape of the pacifier.  We purchased the natural scent as we thought that was safest and we just make sure to wash them often so they don't get the plastic type of smell pacifiers sometimes carry.  But next time we may try to order the vanilla scent just to see what the difference may be.    Pros:   - Love the nose cut-out because they can breathe easily without interference and it is made to conform to their face comfortable - not like the Soothie that takes up their whole face!- Hole for stem is easy for her to put her finger through when she wants to chew on something with some substance  - Medical-grade silicon -> dishwasher safe  - One piece of silicone is easy to clean and doesn't collect in hard-to-reach crevices  - Soft and pliable -> no nipple confusion when breastfeeding  - Firm enough that your little one can chew away but lightweight  - Hole that you can loop a pacifier strap through it to attach to their clothes  - Available in four colors: pink, purple, orange and blue    Cons: NONE!*  *One we received from the hospital recently cracked (after 7.5 months of use) as she liked to chew on all sides of them now that she can grab them herself and she was bending them backwards (against the way they are made to fit smoothly against their face).  I tried giving her one of the others we had until I could order some GumDrops and she put them in her mouth, immediately pulled them out and laid them on the ground all in a matter of two seconds.  That's why I think the full-term are helpful because it's a sturdier silicone likely better equipped for older babies/toddlers.    Just recently we saw [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] are now sold at Target and they have the same shape and appear to be almost identical to these but these also are offered in one more color, green.  I did buy some just to see if they were different and I noticed the difference in the thickness of the silicone in these much clearer than the ones on Amazon.  The First Years 0-3 months version is softer/thinner/more pliable than the 3+ months version which is a thicker/sturdier silicone.  The best price is still on Amazon, but still a good back up if you're ever in a bind.",7/8/2011,-1,1

I think it helps keep the paci in her mouth even better than the elephant. My daughter is now almost 8 weeks old, and she even looks like she is physically holding the caterpillar when she uses it. It will fall out of her mouth but stay close enough that she can root around and get it back in there quite often. Plus, it is adorable!

We have used these since leaving the hospital, and therefore avoided baby waking up in the middle of the night due to losing her pacifier. They stay in because the stuffed animal helps them stay close to their mouth instead of falling out as soon as they stop sucking. As they get older, the stuffed animal serves as a comfort toy, full of texture and appendages to pull. Sometimes baby sucks and chews on everything but the pacifier! They also are easy to wash. We wash the pacifier in the sink, keeping the plush out of the water for quick cleans. Then, when a deep clean is needed (after all that chewing) we wash the whole thing in a delicate laundry bag in the washing machine with her baby clothes.

It is ideal for breastfed babies. That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals.<br /><br />Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings/warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there.<br /><br />Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it):<br />1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab.<br />2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with.<br />3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his/her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and/or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one.<br />4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size!<br />* (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing! Before it was a newborn 0-3 month size, and then a 3/6month -18month size. Now the second size is simply labeled as 3+ months. Still the same pacifier, just new packaging to make sleep-deprived moms feel even more crazy....)",8/23/2012,1,0

He has never had an issue keeping these in his mouth because there is nothing pushing against his nose when he sucks, and because of the contoured shape.    Now I will say that it would be nice if the entire pacifier was solid silicone like the Soothise pacifier is.  I had 2 of the Gum Drop pacifiers begin to peel away along the inside where the internal hard plastic form is.  I contacted the seller who directed me to the Manufacturer.  They were more than appologetic and sent replacements and also a return envelope for the damaged pacifiers.  They seemed genuinely shocked that this had happened to 2 of my pacifiers.  Despite this issue with a few of the GumDrop pacifiers, I still think they are an excellent product.

It can take up to a day for that.<br />They're easier to find in a car, at night, more noticed when dropped. Easier for baby to find it. My little girl loves to hold the ears.

We love this thing.  Our baby was given a soothie at the hospital but we needed a way to keep it off the floor. This thing is a great solution. It is easy to spot across the room. When she spits the pacifier out it will usually just sit on her chest and she can sometimes get it back in on her own even without hands. Now that she is getting older she really seems to like the animal more and more. She pets it to soothe herself to sleep and now that she is interested in toys, she always has one near (even when we forget all her other toys).

Let me count the ways:  1.  One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.

After a couple of duds, we found this.  It's great! My daughter is 18 months and still uses the small rounded size.<br /><br />First and foremost, it had to be safe.  And this is, in many different ways.  Made from natural rubber and oils, I am not concerned about contaminating plastics.  The shape is awesome; it cleans up easily and has no cracks for bacteria to hide when cleaning and sterilizing.  When it first comes out of the box, it is oily.  As others have mentioned, after you wash for the first time, instructions say to boil for a few minutes.  Let it cool and you'll see the oils have been tamed.<br /><br />My daughter loves this paci.  We once ran out of them after I noticed a crack on the side of the nipple (my fault - I let it go much longer than the recommended 6 weeks between replacement).  That was a very long a night.  I tried a few chemical laden replacements until I could get a new shipment in to no avail.<br /><br />All that being said, these are expensive.  And the cost doubles when you realize that you are supposed to replace them every 6 weeks or so.  Much longer than that and the pacifiers start to harden.

Got one as a baby gift and frankly thought it was kind of dumb. I mean, if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal, why do they need to be stuck together?!? And then when our son still wasn't really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks, and after one long evening of paci-spitting and fussing, I figured we might as well try the Wubbanub. Our son loved it pretty much instantly! And the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn't drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck/head. It rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger. And while I fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling, he loves that thing still! It's lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile. He's over 20 months now (entering the territory of restricting it to the crib, car, and emotional moments), but it's easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go. With him on my hip and the paci in his mouth, the giraffe is long enough that I can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing. I'm actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and I don't have the heart to take it away.

I even called gerber, and the lady lied to me saying they never sold a bigger version of this kind of binky. She said it must have swollen to that size. Please.

Finaly I came across this site and it looked very similar to hers. After I read 2 reviews saying the same thing about the gerber binkys, I thought it was worth a try.

We stumbled upon the first one by accident and have been hooked ever since.  These have a Soothie pacifier with an attached animal.  The animal helps newborns keep the pacifier in their mouths.  As the baby grows the animal makes the pacifier easy for them find in the dark and it doubles as a 'lovey.'      The only draw back is the animal is permanently attached.  I have found the easiest way to clean it is to put it in the washing machine.  Do not put it in the dryer (this breaks down the pacifier).  I recommend having several wubbanubs so one can be washed while the baby uses the others.  You should regularly check the pacifier for tears and discard when it gets old and worn.    I recommend having several Wubbanubs.  I keep 1 at day care, 1 in the car, 1 in the diaper bag for back up, and 1 or more in the crib.  This way I don't have to go searching when the baby is crying.

We figure we should just stick with what we have instead of experimenting. We found a similar-looking one by Avent but they weren't the same. Thank goodness Amazon has these. They are exactly the same as the one we got from the hospital except the color but the engraving on the pacifier is all the same. The color for the blue ones is actually much lighter in person than in the picture -- more of a transparent grayish light blue; very pretty though.<br /><br />I personally like how it's one piece so I don't have to worry about loose pieces coming off -- choking hazard. The pacifier is really soft. I know they make harder ones for teethers but these are the softer ones for newborns and non-teething babies. It's very easy to clean and long-lasting. We're actually still using the green one we got from the hospital but having spares make it easier if I have to clean them then I don't have to worry about not having a pacifier available if it's being sterilized. I sterilizes them in boiling water and they stand up to the heat very well.<br /><br />These pacifiers does tend to get stuff like lint and hair stuck on them because of their sticky-ish surface.

Where are these newborns sprouting teeth at 3 months old? The youngest baby I've ever seen with a tooth has been 5 months old. Generally bottle fed babies get them around 6 months, but breast fed babies can go as long as a year or more without them. So it seems kind of silly to be worrying about teeth at this stage. The style purpose is to replace fingers so breaking the sucking habit is a lot easier later down the road.<br /><br />I also will state the same thing here that I did on my Binky review about it staying in the babies mouth. It is meant to simulate a nipple, so you do have to ensure the baby has latched on to it securely before letting go. Otherwise yes, it's not going to stay in their mouth. You don't need a holder... As a mom that has breast fed two babies I assure you they are pros at maintaining a Hoover like suction that is near impossible to break and keeps what they want in their mouth there. If it falls out, the baby either doesn't want it or may have accidentally knocked it out/broken the suction with their hands. The latter can happen with ANY pacifier, and TBH this is one of the less likely models for them to do that to thanks to the lack of a handle.<br /><br />Furthermore, there's no air vents on a breast but somehow baby manages to breath. Could that be the reason they have those upturned pug like noses that give space for air while latched on to the breast? For the record, a doctor pointed this factor out to me in the hospital when a nurse changed our position for feeding reasoning that the baby could not breath in a more natural position. Doc said that was nonsense and that's why babies have the noses they do.<br /><br />Moving on... The things I really appreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap. Always a good thing when it comes to pacifiers. You will lose them by the truck load no matter their design.<br />- As stated earlier, the lack of a handle makes it less likely baby will accidentally knock it out of their mouth.<br />- As someone else pointed out, the hollow tip can have a finger stuck in it to encourage better latching.<br />- They're so freaking cute in the baby's mouth, LOL.<br /><br />One thing I don't like:<br /><br />- The weird silicone piece sticking out of it. Seems the design would be better without it, as while it's more discrete than a handle it still can lead to the baby accidentally knocking it out of their mouth. I figure this is for some kind of accessory, but it's really annoying.ppreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap.

So if your baby loved the hospital pacifiers but rejects the standard bulb shaped ones, this is definitely one you want to try. It is important to note that you must let the baby latch on to these just like you do with a nipple or else it will pop right back out (and may look like the baby is spitting it out). You can't just pop them in and expect them to stay like the bulb shaped ones. However once that latch is established I've found it is way more budge proof than the bulb shaped ones are.<br /><br />Another feature I really appreciate is that the handle is designed to sit flush against the base, making it less likely the baby will accidentally pull it out by the handle.<br /><br />The mouth piece is very soft and supple. The base is surrounded by a ring of silicone to increase comfort.<br /><br />My one week old newborn loves these (he loved the one he got at the hospital). He's had no issues with nipple confusion either. But that's also true of the standard bulb designs.",5/21/2014,1,0

I have bought a lot of specialty baby items because they were supposed to be amazing and help their child develop and make parenting easier.  Most of the items I have gotten just sit in a box after being examined by the baby once and then tossed away in a fit of indifference.<br /><br />One thing that my baby has loved since day 2 has been a pacifier.  She is a big pacifier baby.  I learned quickly that even though young babies can't control their movements and can't throw things, a pacifier that just falls out of their mouth still has the ability to roll far enough away to never be found again.<br /><br />Wubbanubs actually solve this problem.  When a pacifier falls, it can't go far.  If it is thrown, it is easily found.  And when babies start being able to control their hands, they can grasp the stuffed animal and bring it to their mouth much earlier than they would be able to with just a normal pacifier.",11/25/2014,-1,1

He also played with it like a toy. Most of the time,this paci was the only way to calm my son down. I washed it in the regular washing machine with rest of his clothes and dried it in a drier with high temp many times and it was still fine. I ended up buying total 4 of them for my son. The difficult part was to get rid of this pacifier from him. He didn't go to sleep with out it. He became so fussy without it. However, last month when my son was 20 month-old, he chewed the soothie badly and tier all of them off. I didn't buy another one for him but I gave him a little teether just to keep something in his mouth when he gets fussy. First 3 days without this paci were very rough but he became fine without it after a few days. Now he is 21 month old, and still chews on teether a few times a day just for a little bit, but he is completely pacifier-free. I am very happy.

(before, my husband and i would each have to take turns holding him and eating since he hated sitting in his car seat or a stroller at a restaurant.)<br /><br />before we bought this one, we checked out other, less expensive covers. we're happy we got this one because it has the following advantages:<br />1. it is very soft and plush (as i said before), so it pads the seat a bit for your little one.<br />2. it straps to the chair, and has its own little strap that holds the child in (it's like a little triangle-shaped piece of fabric that you put his feet through and straps around his waist, so it really keeps him in there! i've seen toddlers crawl out of restaurant high chairs and onto the table, so i think this feature would come in handy for children older than mine, too).<br />3. the tags! our baby loves them. we also use them as loops to attach links ([[asin:b001abzgu2 bright starts lots of links]]) and toys for our son.<br /><br />the main disadvantage to this cart cover is that it's kind of big. that's no big deal when we're taking it out in the car, but we like to walk places too. so, we purchased a 4l stuff sack ([[asin:b000sthhqi sea to summit ultra-sil stuff sack]], size s) for it, which makes it small enough to squeeze into the diaper bag when we're walking out for dinner. i'd recommend getting one if you're a walker too!<br /><br />we love our cart cover! i'm sure it will be great when we use it on an actual cart, too ;)",8/12/2012,0,0

Fantastic natural pacifier.,"These are my (and my baby's) favorite pacifiers. I love them because they are natural rubber, made of one piece (so no hidden moisture/mold/bacteria issues) and have the lowered curve to go below the nose. The handle is also super easy for my baby to hold and bends easily in case she falls asleep with it and rolls to the side. It doesn't poke her in the face like others I've used. We also have the Ummy and while it's similar I don't like how big the base is...it covers too much of my baby's face for my comfort, despite the holes in it. It's also harder to figure out which way is 'up' when it's dark and I'm trying to quickly put the pacifier in so she can fall back asleep...having the dipped curve in the base makes it to much easier. Since the whole thing is rubber my now teething baby likes to gum the entire thing when she's not using it for its intended purpose. It's kind of funny to watch.  I was at Whole Foods the other day and saw the Eco Piggy, which I almost bought to try but didn't based on the reviews of the bulb part being huge. So I took it out to look at it and sure enough, it's massive! Unless you have a mammoth sized baby I'd skip that one. We're both happy with the Natursutten so I'm sticking to this one.  For those who have complained about the rubber smell/taste...just wash and sterilize it a couple of times and that goes away.",2/28/2015,1,1

This could be a great baby shower gift and I don't think it would be duplicated.  It's not too much to spend either for peace of mind or a gift.

One we passed that magic milestone of four weeks, we opened our new Wubbanub and a fast appreciation was had--babies love to suckle!  It calms them and allows them to gather themselves in the middle of a meltdown.  It is great to carry them through to the next feeding when they get older if you are trying to sleep train.  My son falls asleep within minutes when I put him down in his crib, awake with the Wubbanub--he always spits it out after he is asleep, but no need to restuff his mouth.  The little monkey legs and arms lay on the chest and help the pacifier stay put.  He also loves to grab it with his hands and arms in a big hug.

What I mean is if you are in the car and he's hungry and you need to buy 10-15 minutes to get home to nurse, letting him suck on the pacifier will keep him from a total meltdown. It also is invaluable if he has missed his sleep window and needs the soothing of sucking to settle him down.

I bought these at the grocery store late one night when we were desperate and couldn't find our others and this one was hospital recommended. They are a good pacifier. A few drawbacks to me is the little handle can be awkward and the breathing holes aren't very big.

(Not all babies...my daughter couldn't stand them.)  Like food, clothes, and cars, binkies (aka pacifiers) are a very personal item for a baby.  I know some parents buy a binky only to have their little one spit it out at them.  They then buy another one and the baby loves it!<br /><br />These particular binkies aren't heavy and are geared toward newborns and up.  They're pretty small for little mouths so sucking shouldn't be an issue.  Parents can hold the pinkie in to help the baby get used to it.<br /><br />Fortunately, they're BPA-free and can be washed in the dishwasher.  Personally, I would rather wash it by hand like I did with bottles.<br /><br />Will your baby like these?  It's hard to tell.  Babies are very picky about their binkies.  The only thing you can do is buy the set and try them out.  Amazon doesn't charge too much so testing them out won't break you.  Hopefully your baby will like them and, if he/she does, get more of them!<br /><br />Did I mention the colors?

Whether they鈥檒l take one at all and, if so, what kind they like. It鈥檚 a different answer for every baby.<br /><br />These Munchkin models are lightweight and look well-designed for newborns up to about three or four months of age. They鈥檙e small and specially designed to allow them to get a good, comforting suck going, without blocking their nose. They also don鈥檛 have a handle, because they鈥檙e designed for infants too young to grasp on their own. I鈥檝e found that if a parent puts their finger into the top of the nipple hole (from the opposite side), while the baby sucks, that can help encourage acceptance of a new paci in the very young. These are the perfect size for an adult pinky to slip into.<br /><br />They are listed as BPA-free on the packaging and can be washed in the dishwasher, which is very handy for sterilizing.<br /><br />As to whether YOUR newborn will love this particular style, it鈥檚 really hit or miss. With our (colicky) son we literally bought one of every pacifier from three different superstores and he wouldn鈥檛 take any of them. (Trust me, we would have given anything to find SOMETHING that soothed that kid.) Another child loved only the flat-ended types. (These Munchkin models have the longer, skinny nipples.) Some only like those green models most hospitals give out. Many infants also prefer a certain thickness or type of plastic and for the record, these are very squishy, thin silicone.<br /><br />As a mom, I鈥檒l note that if you find one your baby finds comforting, buy a bunch so you鈥檒l always have one handy.",9/15/2014,1,0

Haba responded quickly and professionally by email and phone, including a request that the pieces be sent to them for further investigation.  The CPSC called me in response to my online report and told me that because of prior complaints, they have an ongoing investigation into these pacifier chains, and they are sending someone out to interview me and take photos of the pieces before they are sent back to the manufacturer.

We no longer have to stop what we're doing and run up stairs for every diaper change.   <br /> <br />Must admit- the music (sounds) and vibration option are rather gimmicky.  We never use these features.  Also, we took it upon ourselves to add our own mobile on the side of the unit- this provides added entertainment for our daughter while we are busy making dinner or fixing her bottle.  <br /> <br />Though she will be nearing the weight limit soon for the changing unit and bassinet features, we plan to leave it in our living room.

I came across the John Frieda hair dryer and read some good reviews so decided I'd give it a shot, plus it was much more affordable than the Dry Bar. Well, I loved it! It only took me 11 minutes to blow dry this mane of mine plus it gave it extra shine and my ends don't look so dry. It also straightened out my hair better than any other hair dryer I've had which cut down my flat iron time, as well.

He bought me both the Featherweight hair dryer and the wet and dry narrow flat iron from t3. I love both of them! The hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes (when it is wet from the shower)- I have asian hair so I can say that drying my hair isn't always a positive experience. However, if you dry your hair with the hot option first (doing the layers), then on the low option for the roots of your hair, and finishing with a blast of cool air all over, you will have shiny hair that is not poofy and is manageable.  <br />After using my t3 hair dryer, I don't know how I could not have it. Now, I want to get the overnight dryer. However, here is a warning. DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES! If you have super frizzy hair or completely unmanageable hair, a hair dryer will not fix that. Perhaps you should invest in some better shampoo (I recommend Bumble and Bumble or Paul Mitchell) and perhaps a hair treatment at the salon. This dryer is great for getting the job done quickly and to make your hair look better (without that frizzy, burned look that other hair dryers give you).",3/13/2007,1,1

I have VERY think and VERY long hair, so finding a dryer that lives up to the task is hard to find.  My hair dryer runs for a good 30 minutes straight which means #1. By the time I get through drying my hair I am sweating due to the heat needed to accomplish this task and #2. My arms are really tired by the time I'm done. Which brings me to the 2 things I absolutely LOVED about this hair dryer.<br /><br />*It didn't take 30 minutes to dry my hair. It took about 15 and my face never felt the heat from the dryer. I'm not exactly sure how this happens, but I found myself on several occasions actually reaching my hand up in front of the dryer to make sure it was blowing hot. It was. All I felt was a cool breeze on my face while my hair took the brunt of the heat.<br />*Even though it looks really heavy (I kind of freaked out at it's size when I pulled it out of the box) it's actually quite light and balanced, so it doesn't put a lot of stress on your arm while you are styling your hair.<br /><br />Now... here are the features that I loved.<br /><br />*It has 3 different speeds & temps allowing you to mix and match according to your hair type. (these are toggle switches)<br />*It has a locking cold button so you don't have to struggle while setting your style & holding down a button at the same time<br />*It came with 3 different attachments, 2 directionals and a diffuser<br />*The ion actually made my hair shiny, so much so that I DIDN'T need to use my flat iron when I was done drying my hair.<br /><br />Overall quality product.

I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.  So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.<br /><br />Pros:  Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.<br /><br />Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen. On both occasions I used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen, causing it to tangle and burn.  In my opinion this is a design flaw. The hole in the back of the dryer is the circumference of my fist!<br /><br />Look to the rusk w8less!  It's an outstanding dryer!",8/17/2015,1,1

I'm so glad I did! I have super thick, coarse, long, wavy/curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years. I'm not sure why I never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference, but I really wish I had figured it out sooner! I learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners; I have the T3 Mane Tamer that I absolutely adore. So, I started there. T3 has a few different dryers, all with positive ratings, and all VERY expensive. I wasn't convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much. I read through tons of reviews for this Onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price. It arrived quickly and I couldn't wait to get it out of the box and use it! Normally, I spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry--not blowing it out, not using any brushes or styling tools/techniques, just getting it dry so that I can use my flat iron. The result (before flat ironing) is what I like to call my &#34;white girl afro&#34;--it is big, it is fluffy and it is crazy!<br />After reading some reviews and Q&As, I switched on the negative ion button, got my round brush and went to town. I could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry. My technique was sadly out of practice and I did end up using my flat iron on a few spots, but I think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice. I really believe that, once I get used to blowing my hair out again, I will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required!!<br />My hair was so smooth and VERY shiny in the end, I was so happy with it. The dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and I love all the options it has with heat/cool, fan speed, etc. The buttons are perfectly located for my taste, not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using. I also love that there is both a cool shot (if you just need a quick blast of cool air) and a cool temperature setting (for when you want cool air for an extended period of time). I was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is. When I first turned it on, it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and I was afraid it wouldn't be very powerful, but that is definitely not the case--plenty of power without all the noise.<br />I am very, very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it.",1/8/2014,1,1

I have used some excellent ionic hair dryers in the past and kept waiting for this one to work as well.  Big mistake.  The high heat is extremely hot and damaging to hair.  The medium heat just doesn't seem to create any smoothness and there is no cooling button.  One must keep switching the heat settings constantly while trying to dry your hair.

It is extremely top heavy and I had the same problem in that yesterday it fell over and the visor in the front broke.

I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.<br /><br />This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).<br /><br />I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic. Therefore, I am taking away 1-star to show this.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*y: *C.S. Light*",8/25/2015,1,1

It does take a tad bit longer to dry your hair, but if you are wanting to straighten your hair you know it takes time to get that look.  It fits well in my hand.  It's not too heavy.  I don't use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn't grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it's so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.  So I have the hairdryer with the brush attached on one side. the hair in the middle (of course) and I have my hand on the other side to keep the hair pressed into the bristles.",11/6/2013,0,1

I have short hair and the dryer dried my hair rather quickly. The two attachments the dryer comes with were easy to place on and remove.<br /><br />There are three heat and two speed selections. I found the  highest heat setting very hot, but it would be perfect for someone with long thick hair. The medium setting works well for my short hair.<br /><br />I have two minor complaints with the dryer: The weight of the dryer is a little heavier than I'm use to and  my 2nd complaint is with the placement of the controls. It made it kind of hard to hold and dry my hair, as I was trying hard not to accidentally change the settings.<br /><br />That will just take some getting use to on my part.<br /><br />Overall, the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer is a great product and certainly worth the price.",12/21/2010,1,1

My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.",1/1/2012,1,1

I had an old Conair hair dryer since early 2000's and it finally took a dive. What I loved about my old dryer was how lightweight and powerful it was.

The Conair 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version, which had the same wattage. It is lightweight, powerful, and so comfortable to use. The switches were an important part for me. I love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you're using it.

It impressed me there immediately. I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package. I wanted something that isn't monstrous and a labor to hold up to use. Also it doesn't take up much wall real estate (a big plus). The night light is a neat feature and won't create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom.

It's got a more quiet engine but still dries fast and I love the retractable cord. I recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily, because the engines aren't super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life. Of course I've had my dryer for months now and it's all working great still, but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren't careful when using it, or just using it too much, it will break eventually. Also- great tip for using the retractable cord- always pull the cord down at a casual pace, don't just yank it. Also, when pressing the button for it to go back in, what I do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button. It keeps from the plugin slapping everything in the area.",9/4/2014,0,1

IT MIGHT END YOUR LIFE.","I bought this product yesterday, and took it out of the box for a test run. Immediately, I liked the color and how light it was. I really wanted to love this dryer, I promise.<br /><br />So, I get it out of the box and unwrap it. Comes with a set of instructions and an individually wrapped concentrator. Never really use those, but cool, okay. I attach the concentrator to the blowdryer, and plug it in - not near any kind of water whatsoever, I assure you.<br /><br />I let it blow out air for a few seconds and adjusted the heat. No lie, literally TEN SECONDS after it was turned on, the blow dryer turned an intense red color. I thought it was just a gimmicky effect, but NO -- the heat was spreading quickly toward the handle and it became unbearable to hold due to the heat within miliseconds. I quickly shut it off, only to see SPARKS FLYING OUT OF THE DRYER. FOR A GOOD FIVE SECONDS.<br /><br />Okay, maybe I did something wrong. Maybe it was a fluke. I take off the concentrator just for good luck, and plug it in again. The thing roars to life, becoming red, and starts to shoot out sparks again almost immediately. A few unfortunate strands of my hair are caught in the frenzy of it all, and are singed.<br /><br />I'm so glad that I didn't wait until I actually had to DRY MY HAIR to test this item out -- who knows what would've happened if the dryer were closer to my hair????<br /><br />I thought I got a lemon of a product, but a quick google search proved me otherwise -- check the one-star ratings here, and you'll know what I'm talking about. A woman on one of the sites I found during my search - search &#34;Dangerous Revlon Hair Dryer Malfunction - PlanetFeedback&#34; to see what I'm talking about - wrote that she actually got THIRD DEGREE BURNS from her product and is planning to sue.<br /><br />I'm shipping this thing back, and am never trusting Revlon again.

I dont use perfume every day, but I keep this little rollerball in my purse cosmetic bag in case I go to an afterwork event or to freshen up if I'm on the go all day before meeting someone out. I'm no scent expert, but to me Fiori d'Arancio smells like *delicate fruit loops* Ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet, clean fruity smell, and smells natural--you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff. its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too, (occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site) and they are expensive, so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size. If the fruit loop smell is not for you, pass it on to a teenage girl you love. Personally I love it! Sometimes I mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent!

Using this dryer with a ceramic brush has my hair dry in under 10 minutes every time. The cool shot option is great for just adding a bit of curl around a brush if you're in a hurry, too! My hair tends to get a bit curly as it dries, so I really like the diffuser attachment as well. It works perfectly to smooth out my hair without it poofing out like crazy.

It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn't even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!  Not fit for my traveling adventures.",6/28/2012,1,1

The Remington didn't last me long (less than a year) and in general was a mediocre hair dryer but it got the job done.<br /><br />I'll start with the cons: I have thick long straight hair with a natural wave, my day to day hair style is scrunched. I have a universal diffuser that I love to use, it's huge and has high sides that are easy to scoop my long hair into. Unfortunately the first thing I noticed about the John Frieda Hair Dryer is the unusual shape of the nozzle. It is big and short and my universal diffuser does not fit it, nor will any universal diffuser on the market (at least I haven't found one yet). So I'm forced to use the attached diffuser that came with it. It does the job but it's not as easy to use as my old one. The buttons are also in a very awkward place, right where my thumb sits when I'm holding it so I'm constantly turning the temperature down by accident. I also end up hitting the cool shot button all the time. It takes some adjustment to get used to.<br /><br />Otherwise, this hair dryer is excellent, it's extremely powerful. It has cut my hair drying time down by half. Most of the time I don't even use it on full heat. If you don't use a diffuser or aren't married to using a larger universal one, I would definitely recommend this hair dryer. If it wasn't so awesome, I would probably return it for not fitting my diffuser but I think using the included one will be an okay compromise for me.",12/3/2011,1,1

I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  The good news is, it dries just fine.  The bad news is that the concentrator attachment (there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening) is unnecessarily difficult to attach.  For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  I had to twist and turn and manuever it every which way.  Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  When it cooled down sufficiently, the twisting and turning began anew.  When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty frustrating.<br />As others have noted, the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily, particularly when using the attachments.  After having owned this for about two months, the chrome is completely chipped off (the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome) where the concentrator attaches.  It doesn't look great, but I don't have to worry anymore about brushing chrome flakes off my clothes every morning.<br />Over the past week, it's gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached, and it's less prone to fall off.  I assume it just took a couple of months to stretch.<br /><br />Update 11/9/10: The attachment no longer will stay on the dryer.  I'm reducing the rating to two stars, because without the attachment, this dryer is worthless to me.",8/19/2010,1,1

Immediately got my hair stuck in the intake and had to turn it off and attempt to use it later.   Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides. This in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air.  The cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out.  I love that it's intended to last 4 years!  One thing I did notice is that you aren't supposed to store it in a damp area so I keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed.  The intake has a wire mesh screen  that could possibly rust so I appreciate this extra advice.  It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.  Update: died and the customer service was impeccable!

My hairdryer gave out recently so I was on the hunt for a new one. I purchased one in the store for double this price and I was not satisfied with it. It left my hair frizzy. One of my favorite things about this hairdryer is the slanted handle. It fits perfectly in my hand and it's just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand. Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster. I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head. I can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair. I love the 3 temperatures. Most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down. This hairdryer not only has the cold press button, but also high heat, low heat, and cool. So you don't have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough. I like to start out on high heat all over then I divide my hair and use low heat. After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option. The concentrator nozzle is just the right size. You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning. This is an amazing hairdryer. I love that I got the opportunity to test this hairdryer in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I would definitely recommend this hairdryer!",2/16/2015,1,1

I like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference. The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful. Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well. The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly. It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz. The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed. I also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter, it was easy to twist off for cleaning. Overall, it's powerful and does a nice job. I loved the look and it's easy to hold and use. Hoping it will last awhile.

My hair is super long and super thick and usually takes 7 minutes at the fastest, especially when my hair is still pretty wet because I pretty much just got out of the shower. I was absolutely stunned by the drying time. In fact, it dried my hair faster than my much more expensive dryer I've been using for the last few years.<br /><br />I used it on the highest heat setting and and speed setting. You can dry it slower if you like, but I read somewhere awhile back that it's better to dry on a higher speed and higher temp, and get the heat off your hair as quickly as possible, so thats just how I've always dried my hair. Plus I'm usually in a big hurry so this works best for me.<br /><br />Once dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier too!<br /><br />While using this dryer the last week, I have also noticed my hair has been much less frizzier too, especially for this time of year! It's so cold and dry here, my hair usually goes POOF! As soon as I walk out the door, but my hair has been surprisingly tame this week, I think in thanks to my new Xtava Blowdryer!<br /><br />I also love that this hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle so I can deliver lots of heat to one specific area. I didn't always dry my hair this way until recently, but I've found it really dries your hair so much faster!<br /><br />This hair dryer is also quite noticeably lightweight! I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package. I love that you can hold it on your hair for several minutes and never get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that's just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can't sit still just doing my hair! Otherwise, it has perfect reach for standing in front of the mirror and bending over to blast underneath your hair!<br /><br />I'm completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market!

My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn't limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended!",6/14/2011,0,1

Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!  So, I gave this baby five stars and hope to have it around for four or five years like all the other Conairs before it.",5/13/2012,1,1

So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends.

I'm thinking about using it as punishment (not really, but I probably could).  I don't get it, though. That's how hair dryers sound.  She winced at a 1200W mini, too.<br /><br />My cord retracts just fine, not like a shade, but I'm glad to have the heftier/safer cord without a vicious, finger-eating spring.  it took hundreds of in-and-outs for my old one to give out.<br /><br />The switches could have benefited mightily with even a slightly a concave dragging surface.

Oily pigmented stuff shows up on this and can be hard to get really clean. 90% rubbing alcohol does the trick.  I still love it.<br /><br />My attachments stay on, tightly. (Save the rubber bands from your broccoli and wrap them around the dryer exhaust to increase its diameter.  Cram-like-heck the attachments onto the dryer.

For the low price of the product $23.00 I don't think it's worth sending a second one back for warranty replacement. Shipping two units back is going to cost more than the original product.    Really nice item, I wish that they made it of quality parts I would surely pay 2-3 times the price to get one that will last longer than a couple of months.

Thank goodness I was nearly done blow drying my hair because I could only blow cold air unless I physically pried the button back up.

I liked the way the dryer angled down, the controls looked high enough up so I wouldn't be changing the settings, and I especially loved the color!  Well, don't let the color sway you.  I ordered the dryer, and it's fabulous!  It's full-sized, powerful, quiet, and my fingers don't continually change the settings.  It takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder-length, straight hair, and that's at medium heat, high power.  I'm so pleased with this hair dryer, and did I mention that I love the beautiful blue color?",6/14/2015,1,1

The colors are buildable (you can easily add more to any look), but they go on VERY sheer. They are meant more for enhancing natural lip color than for actually changing their color, and touch ups are necessary after just an hour or two. If you choose to purchase this product, I recommend buying a lip stick primer that will prolong the color for awhile. As I said, they are very sheer, so if you are looking more for a rich lipstick shade than just a tinted gloss, I suggested not throwing away your $18. You will be very unhappy.

I have to be very careful when I move it around my head, it's easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally.  Also the head is LONG; I have long hair too, and I'm a tiny person.

I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven't given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer.",7/4/2013,1,1

I'm so glad i ordered this product. It is top heavy when you try and roll it I support the bottom and top as I push but it mainly stays in one spot. The bell can be a bit startling but mainly because you tune out the sound of the dryer so when the timer goes off you've forgotten what you were doing. i dont find it necessary to crank the heat all the way up, at mid range my hair is dry in about 40min.

There is a screw for you to change the voltage. It's almost as powerful and heats up like a regular dryer, which is a huge plus for me.  I've got a ton of hair and those wimpy hotel Sunbeam wall mount dryers just don't cut it.<br /><br />Cons: It's expensive. I would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full-size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot, as I do, the voltage option is key. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so I would not recommend this if you're looking for something small. There is a hinge at the handle that allows it to fold but it's still far from compact.<br /><br />I've been taking this dryer with me to Europe and it works great. I've been using it intermittently for a year and it's still going strong. Essentially, it's a full-size dryer but with a voltage option.

It was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped.  After years though, that blow dryer died and I needed to replace it.  I always go with Conair because they make a trusty, yet inexpensive, product.  I chose this one because of the retractable cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage.  I figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage, the folding handle has to be even better, right?  Plus, I'm traveling internationally this year, so I thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion.  While I had high hopes for his blow dryer, it has really been nothing but disappointing...<br /><br />The blow dryer itself works great, like any other Conair I've owned.  The retracting cord, the folding handle, and the dual voltage switch, however, do not.  The joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy.  The top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and I'm sure this will only get worse over time.  This feature doesn't seem built to last.  The retractable cord also doesn't retract.  It gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer.  It's not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works, but it is definitely irritating since I bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature.  I don't know for sure, but in my opinion, I think the retractable cord doesn't work right because of the folding handle.  It just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and I think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle.

Unless you're traveling with Thor, I wouldn't count on this feature.  Luckily I have a power converter for other electric items, so I can use that with the blow dryer...if it makes it that long.

It's a bit heavier but not bothersome at all, and I even have tennis elbow which prevents me from lifting things a certain way, if they weigh over 3# or so. This is very comfortable in the hands, has enough settings, a cold shot button, and most importantly, a diffuser for when I want to go from stick straight hair to beachy waves. The quality seems great and sturdy, I love the pink on it, and whatever the coating is is also pretty cool.<br />After my Conair experience, I don't have much faith in new hairdryers. I was using an old folding travel dryer I have (from 2007) that still works great and I plan on using for traveling, so my intent was to use the Remington for the diffuser.

Every time I went to a hotel, I wrote down the brand with the intention of ordering one. Finally my old blow dryer went kaput, so I had an excuse to purchase this one.<br /><br />First of all, I don't know why the photo shows it somewhat pearly looking: it's plain old white. Second, it was a bit larger than I expected and so it wouldn't fit in the spot I had chosen for it. I ended up having to mount it above a towel bar since if it was below it would either be in the way of the light switches or it would have to under the hand towels and make an odd bulge. So I put it in myself--didn't use the anchors as I think it will stay in place without. I hung a little picture next to it so it wouldn't look so out of place above the towel bar by itself.<br /><br />It works just as expected and I love having it ready to go whenever I am. One advantage I discovered with mounting it higher is that it's never going to get caught on knobs or anything else--a frequent frustration when I'm tired in the morning. We had our first really cold day here (in the South) and I found it's also handy for warming yourself up quickly when coming out of the shower; I've suggested it to my husband for that purpose (he's bald and otherwise wouldn't need it).<br /><br />I'll update my review if I ever have problems with it, but so far it's great--just have to get used to seeing it there on the wall.",11/14/2013,1,1

As a frequent dry shampoo user, I have to say this one has the freshest shampoo-like scent and it really works without leaving a residue. The problem, which I am unable to overcome, is the issue with the sprayer getting clogged. Luckily, I bought my product from a local cosmetics shop and they allowed me to RETURN FOUR BOTTLES in a row. I tried hot water, I tried cleaning the nozzle. I never tried sticking an earring in it like another reviewer suggested, but I had enough. Probably because of their embarassment, one of the cosmetic store employees told me they had heard Ojan was improving their bottle. So I waited diligently for about a year before purchasing another bottle only to find that, just like before, after about 2 uses, the nozzle clogs.     DEAR OJAN - PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR PACKAGING DESIGN SO I CAN CONTINUE TO USE YOUR PRODUCT!!! It is a horrible design flaw that has to cost a ton of money in returns and in loss of potential return customers - LIKE ME!    Now I use Oscar Blandi's power, which is a fabulous product, but sprays are just a little better. I have heard similar reports in Blandi's spray and have avoided it as a result. Fuhrer's didn't really do much for me and a drugstore brand named Salon Grafix (SG) works effectively but smells like old lady hairspray.",8/5/2010,1,1

I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.<br /><br />My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.<br /><br />My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.<br /><br />To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!",7/18/2015,1,1

The medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting.  I have twin daughters that are young and I think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat Setting. This dryer is so powerful,  yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer. My husband even commented on how quiet it is. My husband also liked the fact that it is heavier.  Being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger,  more durable motor.

You won't regret this purchase,"This is a GREAT dryer and my review will compare the Sedu Revolution 4000i with the Harry Josh Pro Dryer 2000.<br /><br />When the Harry Josh 2000 dryer came out I was dying to buy it but just couldn't justify the price. I was in desperate need of a good dryer (since I straighten my hair almost every day).  After lots of research and reading reviews on every single dryer out there, I decided to go with the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i. Especially since it was chosen by Harry Josh himself as HIS FAVORITE DRYER (obviously before he developed his own dryer)鈥o I figured the Sedu was a great choice. I've loved this dryer since day 1. Love it. But鈥 still had my heart set on the Harry Josh dryer. I figured it would be even better than the Sedu and somehow cut my dry time to mere seconds :)<br />I finally justified the purchase of the Harry Josh by telling myself that my Sedu would be my travel / back up dryer. After all, everyone needs an emergency blow dryer!<br /><br />So the Harry Josh dryer arrives and I immediately notice it's the same exact body casing as the Sedu. Even the attachments are exact and fit on both dryers. EVERYTHING and I mean everything right down to the cord length, switches, markings and body size were exact. Even the motor sounds exactly the same when turned on. The only difference I can see is that one is mint green and one is black.<br />Now I admit, I don't know what kind of motor each one has, but it seemed strange to me that Harry's new $250-300 dryer appears to be the exact same machine as his once beloved &#34;favorite dryer.&#34; So I decided to perform my own dry test and see which one, if any, dried my hair faster and made it smoother.<br /><br />I tested for six total days. For three days I dried with the Sedu and for three days with the Harry Josh. I alternated days to account for weather, humidity in the air, more or less product applied, etc.<br /><br />On all six days I followed the same exact routine (water temp / shampoo / conditioner / other hair product)<br /><br />Here's what I found:<br /><br />The Sedu Revolution dried my hair approximately one to two minutes faster than the Harry Josh on all days. On average, using the Sedu, it took about 5:30 min to get my hair dry and approx 7 minutes to dry it with the Harry Josh.<br /><br />The Harry Josh DID make my hair a slightly smoother, but nothing really earth shattering.<br /><br />I decided to keep my Sedu and return the Harry Josh.<br /><br />Note: My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length, curly, fine, and a little frizzy. It's also color treated.<br /><br />So all in all, I highly recommend the Sedu Revolution TGR 4000i dryer. Even though it's expensive it's totally worth it if you straighten your hair a lot.

I dried my hair no more than once a week for that reason, but I can't wait to use it every time, if I keep getting these results.

After researching many available on Amazon and other websites, I chose the Andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord. I've been using it now for two months.     Since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet, it having a nightlight was dead useful.  I read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright.  My husband and I disagree. We love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer.  It is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light.  Isn't that the point of a nightlight?  Maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don't close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep? My solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case!    Sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature!  The hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and I use it on the 1600 because I have massively thick hair.  It dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud.  I like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom.

The first one was terrible.  The one I got rid of had a short barrel and sucked my hair into the intake in the back and ended up burning up the 3rd time I used it.  I've had this one a little over a month and it is so much better.  Easy to mount.  Easy to use.  I love that it turns off when you set it back in the cradle.  Cord gives enough to stretch down low when I blow dry my daughters hair.  Only negative is that there is no heat control.  High air setting has high heat.  Medium air has medium heat.  Low air has luke warm heat.  But since I prefer the high air/high heat it works ok for me.  I recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE12/2012:  Around the beginning of 2012 the unit's high setting stopped working.  Or rather it works intermittently.  Sometimes it will come on but most times it does not.  This makes it hard to dry thick or long hair.  The heat & air volume on the other settings doesn't cut it if you want to dry your hair quickly or if you have a lot of hair.  Still pretty good product in terms of size/design/price and maybe I'm expecting too long a life from a hair dryer, but I do know that most of the others dryers I've owned lasted 6-8 years.

Needless to say, its color, size, sound and portability mattered. I chose this and couldn't be happier. He loves it too. The heat of both settings is ideal, it worked well for my hair too. The fact that it is dual voltage was not as important to me, although we travel to Europe a lot, but I can use the dryers in the hotel itself. It does sound a little louder than I had thought after reading reviews that it was quiet. The other issue is that the slider switch is a little difficult to operate and tends to slide all the way from end to end. It is difficult to move to the off position in the center.",10/26/2013,0,1

It left it looking smooth and with a nice shine. She didn't get the fly away messy look from it. I started out using the hot setting and then moved down to the warm setting as her hair was drying. She liked that I was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs. I love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing. Makes it much easier to put away when done using it and also makes it nice while using it that you don't have to have a long cord dangling in your way. I don't mind the color, it actually looks more of a reddish purple to me than pink. The dryer is a little bulky for smaller hands.

Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it's going in the electronic recycling bin.<br /><br />Sept 2015 Review: I've had this dryer for a year now and it's held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.<br />My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there's a worn section. I'm still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.<br /><br />Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don't fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten. Don't rely on all the reviews of &#34;too heavy&#34;, &#34;buttons wrong location&#34;, &#34;too loud&#34;, etc... Purchase and use, judge for yourself.

It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.<br /><br />My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer. Overall, however, I definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features, works very well and is such a great value!",8/15/2015,1,1

Mine is still working,  but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  I've always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  This hair dryer is awesome.  I had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference,  but I didn't realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer.  Not only does it dry my hair faster,  but it leaves it looking much more healthy.  I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  I don't know all the &#34;how&#34; or &#34;why&#34; reasons,  but I do know that my hair didn't look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it.  I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  I don't use the high heat on this one because it's very hot and my fine hair wouldn't like that,  but I like knowing that the option is there if needed.  The air flow with this is massive.....really powerful... When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  but that's only when I'm just drying it to put in a ponytail.  Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  It's not a small dryer,  but it's not at all heavy ,  especially considering the power that it contains.<br />  They include a little card explaining that their products are made by women.

It's light-weight so my arms don't get tired, and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly - about 5 mins with styling. I also like that it doesn't have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason. I saw the review about it not working right in Spain, but I was very pleased with how it worked in Greece. There is a screwlike switch you have to turn for European voltage and I wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this? When the hair dryer is set to European voltage, there is only one speed (high), instead of the usual high and low, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in Greece, just as it did at home - same strength and heat. The only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products I use and then the dryer would overheat - but this is something I have to do with any hairdryer I purchase. After being used everyday for about three years, it's starting to sound as if the motor is going and so I'm back to buy another one. My daughter tried mine and liked it so much, she got one also.

I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I'd try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don't have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.

And I couldn't be happier!!!  My hair is:    1). Straight  2). Smooth  3). NOT Frizzy  4). Shiny  5). Volumous  6). Looks like I just got a blow out at a salon    Let me start at the beginning.  My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?

I have to completely and forcefully dry it in order to tame it down.  I've bought dozens of blow dryers in my lifetime to battle my hair, most from the drugstore.  Despite having consistently mediocre-to-poor experiences with these cheapies, I stupidly found myself continuing to buy them.  I have no fewer than 4 unused Conairs relegated to the hall closet because they don't perform acceptably.  And that's in addition to the countless ones that I've thrown away when they broke.      So I finally decided to change tactics and buy a higher end model.  My hair stylist recommended the Elchim brand, as that's what they use in the salon I go to (Vidal Sassoon salon).  It's definitely a step up from the Conair, but there are some things I don't love about it.    Things I Like:  -Good, strong air flow  -Feels Solid - plastic feels strong and not flimsy.  I've only had it for a few weeks, so it remains to be seen how durable it is compared to the drugstore cheapies, but it feels like it won't break as quickly.  -Long cord so you can move around as needed  -3 settings each for air flow and heat    Things I Don't Like:  -Hottest setting is extremely hot.  I burned my finger by touching MY HAIR after drying a lock on the hottest setting!  Unfortunately, the medium setting isn't quite hot enough.  So I've been using the hottest setting and moving it around fast so it doesn't heat up one area long enough to fry my hair or my fingers.  It's tiring and I'm hoping it doesn't damage my hair long term.  -No cool shot.    Overall, seems like a step up from the cheap drugstore dryers because the air flow is much better and it feels more durable (we'll see if that proves true over time), but for some people it might not be worth paying twice as much.",8/24/2009,0,1

I love them, even the original strips work great.  These 5 minute strips, however, I was not impressed with and found them to be pretty much ineffective.  My advice to those with sensitive teeth:  rather than buying these strips, buy the originals or an upgraded version and use them less often than as directed to reduce sensitivity.  Use them once every few days or once a week rather than the recommended once or twice a day.  You will still get great results, but giving your teeth a break in between uses will dramatically decrease any pain from sensitivity.",8/5/2010,0,1

This one is so good that I find myself walking from one end of the house to the other in the morning to dry my own hair at the changing table. Without a mirror, no less. It's that good. So I just need to get a second one now because I can't keep this extra activity up.<br />Oh, and it's loud (I don't know how they'd make one that isn't), but I love the 4 settings (cool slow, warm fast, hot slow, and hotter fast) and it dries my hair in half the time as my old crappy one does.

I was fed up having cheap blow dryers that never lasted. I loved the blow dryer, it lasted me till a month ago. Guess the $110 I paid for it back then was worth the 6 years I got out of it. I was looking at buying the same one or at least a Chi blow dryer again, I just didn't want to spend the same amount of money, I was hoping to stay under $60. I did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer, T3 Featherweight, was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what I wanted to pay and $30 cheaper than the Chi I had before. I also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old Chi, which I prefer since I have a ton of hair. After using it for over a week. I think it works pretty good.. not much difference from my Chi I had. It's lighter than my chi and it's made of some kind of plastic like material. It also looks solid white and black in the picture, but it's actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which I'm not thrilled with, but it's not the reason I bought the blow dryer so I'll get over it. Seems to take about the same amount of time to blow dry my hair as the chi, maybe a little faster. I usually take about 8-15 minutes to blow dry my hair depending on how detailed i get with it, like I said I have a ton of hair. (thick Mid-back length hair)<br /><br />Why I give this a 4 instead of a 5, I prefer my Chi a little more, maybe it's the solid feel of it.

I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck.

I stopped for awhile then got back into it just recently over this past summer. I started with Australian Golds Cheeky brown which was alright for starters. Then moved on up to Australian Golds Wicked. Stuck with that one for about 2 months but was longing to get more out of my tanning session. So I read the mixed reviews about Bombshell here. Some people loved it some didn't (shrugs). Now me personally, I love tingling lotions. And not only did this one have a kewl name and 100xx, which was WAAY more then I'd ever used. But it has a foxy lil 1950s pin up girl on the label. :D So I ordered it, it arrived rather quick. It only tingled  like, 3 times when first using it.  The smell is awesome. I didn't feel like I needed to run home and take a shower after applying it. All in all, if you like that tingle factor. And are looking to get a better more dark color. I totally recommend this lotion. ^_^",1/9/2012,1,1

I'm very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.<br /><br />I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference.

I have always bought the cheap hair dryers at my local chain stores.  I had no idea what a difference a high quality hair dryer would make on my hair.  I have long hair (about to the middle my shoulder blades) and whenever I have to dry it I have to follow up with a straightening iron.  I am pleased to report that with the T3 Featherweight I no longer have to use my straightening iron.  My hair is straight, silky, and smooth to the touch...I was actually shocked the first time I dried my hair.  Not only did it look great but it took less time than normal (about 5 minutes less).  I do love that this hair dryer is so lightweight and quite.    My one and only complaint is that the T3 Featherweight hair dryer works for about 1 1/2 years before it shorts out.  It has happened twice with two different featherweight dryers.  With the featherweight costing me $200 you would think that it would last longer! Unfortunately my replacement T3 Featherweight hair dryer died yesterday (and it's no longer under warranty), so I bought a different professional brand hoping it will last longer. Sorry T3, I had to move on!!!    ALSO TO NOTE...when I received my first T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 2006 & the replacement one in 2008, the company (Bespoke Labs) had a 4 year warranty on their featherweight hair dryers.  Now I have noticed that Bespoke Labs has changed the warranty on this hair dryer to only 2 years!!!  Interesting!",4/3/2010,1,1

Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.<br /><br />A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands.

At first, it leaves somewhat of a greyish cast but i think this neutralizes yellowish asian undertones once product settles into skin.  Later skin79 gold adjusts a bit to my skin color though i think it is a tad light for me.  i think longevity is about 3-4 hours with primer so i put a finishing powder (drugstore brand) over it so it would last 6-8hrs?  Using a powder similar to your coloring will help make this skin79 product 'match up' to ur skin coloring (IF you are about nc30 or more).  I really think powdering is a must for this product.  Honestly, i have to have powder for this or it wont last long and coloring looks  a bit off.  It isnt drying, and u dont become 'oily' after several hours (not quite dewy but healthy moisturized skin).  You never feel u r wearing makeup with this on (even with primer + BB cream +powder).<br /><br />Compared to other products:  i feel it does 'brighten' the face a bit compared to the other skin79 sampler items.  I found oriental bb gold too oily at the end of day (though loved its initial dewiness),  pink one made my skin look dead and didnt last long and blemish diamond bb cream was too sparkly to use.  I have also used Sephora and laura merceir oil-less tinted moisturizer and found these too oily and 'dead-looking' respectively on my skin.  Laura mercier brand oxidized way too much for me and made me feel like i was wearing a fake mask at end of the day (i even tried 2-3 different shades!).

I found that the hairdryer volume while running is pretty acceptable (not sure if I'm alone on this, but I hate really loud hair dryers).

Over time, I noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out.  I attributed it to a new medication I was taking.  My curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now I assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds. I also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts & blows out my hair, I have soft normal hair.  I thought it was her hair products that gave that result.  While ordering this as a gift for someone recently, I noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to MY hair too! I bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal, soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it.

The hair dryer does not have that high pitch noise that makes it sound like a jet engine.  It makes a noise that I have not heard in a hair dryer before.  I would call it more of a low roar versus the high shriek of the older models.<br /><br />My wife was very impressed with the effectiveness of the dryer.  She said that it dried her hair in about half the time as her old dryer.<br /><br />The dryer does feel like it was build solid.  The outside casing has a rubbery type feel as opposed to the hard smooth plastic most dryers are made of.<br /><br />My wife is thrilled with how fast it dries her hair.

I had to pay $15 in shipping to return it to them. I think that's totally bogus, given that the unit shouldn't have had ANY problems in that timeframe. Hopeful, I sent it along. In about three weeks, they sent me another dryer--same model.<br /><br />Having used the only other dated dryer I had in the house during that three weeks, I can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally. I recall now why I I loved the predecessor of this dryer, and this one, before it became problematic. It's quieter, the temperature is more controllable, it's well-vented and easily cleaned. Also, the refinement attachments actually fit the former model, snugly. They fall off this one--the one from the deceased predecessor, and the one that came with this replacement. It's virtually no use to me without the attachments.<br /><br />But honestly, I am not motivated to rate it any higher, because I don't have faith this one will last.

First one quit working in 2 months.  Replacement ALSO quit working after 3 months.  I still haven't gotten all the gory details on WHERE to send this second defective unit.  Plus, I have to pay to ship it there AND include a check for $14.95 for processing.  Some warranty. It may be 4 years, but is it worth the hassle - time & expense - of returning every 3-4 months?  The worst part is that the first one was a gift from my sister-in-law and she was mortified so handled the first replacement...the store kindly exchanged it for her.  She paid $200 for the darn thing, so I would hope so!  In any case, I did not want to prevail upon her kindness again, so decided to handle this one myself.  I go to the web site - no info there - says to call them.  I call them.  They tell me to go to the website and send an email.  Huh?  Why couldn't they have just said that on the website?  I suspect because they have a LOT of defective units but don't want people to guess that, and if they had the warranty info there, well, it would be a negative and not a positive.  At any case, and at that kind of money, there should be better quality control (AND WARRANTY instructions!) so that I don't have to go thru this every 3 months!  What is wrong with this picture?  Yes, buy it if you want to deal with the warranty mess and inconvenience and cost.  You'll love it for the 3 months, miss it for 2 months while awaiting the warranty info/replacement...and then the cycle will begin again.  I have very thick hair with waves and it works wonders and leaves my hair shiny.  But, geesh, I could never recommend it to anyone.  $200 and I have to send it back for warranty every 2-3 months.  Hello??? Bespoke are you listening????  My friends would never forgive me if I recommended such a poor quality product to them.  Now that I had to prevail upon my sister-in-law to get her receipt, and I have it in hand, I can now spend my money to send the thing back.  This has added 3 weeks to the delay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.

They get up in the morning about 1.5 hours before we do, to go to school. For years the last hour of our sleep was inturupted and we might as well have gotten up with them. This dryer makes 70% less noise & drys their hair in way way less than half the time. The air velocity & heat is not matched by anything out there. Trust me I have bought them all, looking for some peace & quiet in the morning. The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch). They drop this thing every day, yes I hear it even over the use noise and it take a beating. I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes.

I don't use a blow dryer to style my hair, but rather to dry it after showering.  I have very thin, fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away.  The hand dryer I've had for over 15 years did the job, but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying, my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat.  Not attractive!<br /><br />So when it came time to buy a new dryer, I took a look at the ionic ones, which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away.  And since this one was so inexpensive, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />Well, it's fabulous!  When dried with this dryer, my hair actually feels silky.  And my hair has NEVER felt silky!  And to make things even better, that silkiness lasts between shampoos.<br /><br />I've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn't strong enough, or it doesn't get hot enough.  They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair.  But the blower seems strong enough for me.  My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.<br /><br />But what makes this so great isn't the heat or the amount of air, it's the ionic thing.  I don't know why it works, or how it works, but I love this thing, and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.<br /><br />It's a great dryer and it won't set you back much.

Awful button placement.,"**Review about BLACK CHROME version.**<br /><br />It's always a pain buying a new hair dryer--you're used to the one you had, annoyances and all, and it's a crap shoot as to whether or not you'll like the one you've bought sight unseen (although you've read the reviews and are hopeful).<br /><br />I wanted to love this hair dryer, but overall I just didn't.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that it is HEAVY. Well, not a bag of flour heavy, but it certainly has a definite heft to it (heavier than I was used to, at least) and for someone who needs to spend a good 30 constant minutes holding it and moving it around...it was heavier than I'd prefer.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed is that the cord is REALLY long. I never gave much thought to cord length, but it is advertised as 10 feet and I'm sure it is. I can't say as if I ever need a cord that long--in all my years using a hair dryer, I think a 3' cord would be plenty.<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was that the attachments are metal--which at first I thought was a bonus because it meant they would be sturdier. That said, since they are metal, they get HOT during use! Surprise, I know, right? Hee. But when you're used to plastic and suddenly have metal and you forget and grab the end...OUCH! Also, the attachments were a bit of a pain to put on. I had to fight with one of them because it didn't seem to want to click on easily (or at least as easily as any dryer I'd used before). I did finally get it on, and thought Well, at least it will STAY on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the resin pick attachment, which, in addition to being super awkward to use, came flying off the end in about seven seconds. The other concentrator attachments were fine, but that pick one was useless.<br /><br />The fourth thing I noticed is that the button placement SUCKS. I managed to turn it off at least 10 times in the first two minutes of using it. SOOOOO frustrating. Just grabbing the handle to hold it would bump it to OFF. GRRRRR. I tried to be especially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period, and I did get better, but I still turned it off repeatedly.<br /><br />The fifth and final thing I noticed is that the hot is REALLY SUPER HOT. I mean, so hot that you do have to really be careful how long you point it at your scalp--and I'd NEVER use it on my hair without putting some form of styling protectant on it first.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration, this was NOT the hair dryer for me. AT ALL. It was too heavy (minus one star), had hard-to-attach and useless attachments (minus one star), and had sucky button placement (minus one star).

The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.<br /><br />This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it's not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.<br /><br />I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn't say Conair underneath, though it does say Conair on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it's just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it's a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn't last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn't find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer.

I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It's just a little longer than this one and it's so easy to attach it. If they'd made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.<br /><br />Even so, the blow dryer is great.

I couldn't believe it and got the old one out of the trash to compare side by side. Shorter. By a lot.

This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!",6/15/2007,-1,1

One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.<br /><br />All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.<br /><br />I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.<br /><br />I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.<br /><br />Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well.

I previously owned a large Panasonic 1250w monster that was awesome, however, after it unceremoniously died after only a couple of years, I was looking for something that wouldn't quiet eat up so much counter space.  After coming across this one, I was a tad reluctant to pull the trigger on this little guy for a couple of reasons: #1 - What if it was actually TOO small? & #2 - It didn't have the crazy power of my last one & I'm impatient.  Alas, I bit the bullet & have been VERY happy with it ever since!  I've realized that I never actually *cook* dishes in the microwave (totally not counting late night Easy Mac liaisons), so it's actually perfect for me for heating up leftovers, making popcorn, heating up water, etc.  I was pleasantly surprised that even with less power than my last, I still don't feel like I am waiting any longer to get my food hot.  It was a little weird not having a number pad to select a specific time for about a day; now it's no big deal at all.  I usually just press the start button a few times, getting the time up to whatever I want it to be & let it go.

I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath.",7/3/2013,-1,1

Bad product.  Expensive repairs. Poor support.<br /><br />I have owned 3 of these. All white not stainless.  I talked a friend into buying a stainless one ( he bought110v - bad move... underpowered ) I love the concept.  But at this point I'd strongly recommend  you stay away from this product.  I'm talking about the 220v Advantium oven.  My experience:<br />I had the house rewired to put this 220v oven above the stove.<br />  The first one I owned lasted about 1 1/2 years, then the bottom heating element (a halogen bulb) burnt out.  I had service replace it.  About 1/2 a year later the controller for the microwave burnt out.  When it worked, it worked great. So, I replaced the whole unit.<br />  The second one was exactly the same design: 220v with halogen bulb lower heating element.  After about 2 years, the halogen bulb again burnt out.  Again after another year, the whole unit broke to the point I again replaced it.<br />  So, I really liked the concept, but obviously the design engineering was bad.  This was severely pointed out in the 3rd 220v unit I bought:  They changed the design!  They replaced the lower halogen heating element with an infrared heating element.  Halogen bulbs are near instant on.  Infrared takes time to heat up.  So, frozen 12&#34; pizza took a bit longer to cook, and all the recipes that relied on bottom heat was off a bit... seemed like they changed the heater characteristics without bothering to reprogram the recipes, but Ok.  I still liked the concept.<br />  Then, the lower now infrared heater failed.  So I called service. They replaced the part.  But now... it wouldn't  even cook a pizza.  Too little power from the lower heating unit.  Service came out to fix it again.  Then, I cooked a pizza in front of the technician that replaced the bulb. The &#34;cooked&#34; pizza came out burnt on the top, and the bottom uncooked: &#34;floppy slices&#34;.  The product after repair, no longer performed it's function.  I had many calls into GE consumer relations.  No help.  At the end, I was told the fixed product worked as designed, and there was nothing more they would do on this unit.  They were willing to sell me a 4th one.  When I asked how it would cook, he didn't know.<br /><br />Love the concept, but bad execution, and expensive and poor support.",6/15/2015,1,1

This thing is a knockout!!,"We've had the big 'ol &#34;over-the-range massive GE microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but, when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro-style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it, that oversized radar box had to go! But what to get to replace it? Looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them -- &#34;compact&#34; they were not!<br /><br />And then we found this Whirlpool TV set, er, I mean microwave! Whomever designed this deserves a Nobel Prize for peace, physics and common sense!! It looks just like a cute little old school TV set. Imagine that! A cute microwave oven! But what's even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop. Somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here's the best: you can place a full-size 11&#34; dinner plate inside! How'd they do that??!!<br /><br />Negatives? Nothing terrible. Yes, it's only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former &#34;beast-master&#34; machine but, as another reviewer said, just 'cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn't mean ya should!! We use our microwave for vegetables, eggs, liquids, popcorn -- all of which the new cute Whirlpool TV/microwave thingee will do just fine. Takes an extra 15-30 seconds because of the lower power. That just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is.<br /><br />And speaking of boxes, this is serious out-of-the-box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles. Major kudos to Whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different. Steve Jobs would have loved this microwave -- form and style perfectly matched with function. It's time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game.<br /><br />Bottom line? Outstanding microwave!",1/19/2014,1,1

I was worried about it making soup spill with jerky loading, but I haven't found that to be a problem.<br />The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the interface is a bit clumsy.  For pretty  much everything, it requires too many key strokes to get it doing what you want. It's like the old days of operating a VCR. way too complicated. It's like you have to keep the manual out on the counter if you want to do anything other than run if for 1, 2 or 3 minutes.  defrosting = difficult .. timer = difficult... resetting the clock = difficult<br />In summary: as long as your key objective is to get the microwave off of the counter, and you only plan on using it to reheat things at max heat, then you will love it.",8/29/2013,0,1

There is no grove in the floor bottom in which the plate would normally sit.<br />The whole unit is easy to clean- ALL, including the inside, is flat and smooth- no dials or protrusions. It has only a 30 second button, so must press the button 8 times to get 4 minutes- which perfectly heats a cup of coffee.

All the cabinets were custom made and one side of the island was designed to accommodate the KB-6524ps dimensions. For the first 13 months we loved this product, then the automatic open/close door feature stopped working. I called Panasonic and they were no help since it was out of warranty. I searched the internet for a authorized repair company and when I called them, they gave me a price of $295 to repair the problem (including travel), so we decided to live with manually opening and closing the door.<br /><br />3 months later, we were using the microwave and we noticed a burning smell. We shut the microwave off and waited a while and tried it again. Same thing only stronger smell. I called the same repair company and they told me the motor had gone and that this is a typical problem with these units. To replace the motor was $610 including travel. So we stopped using the microwave.<br /><br />2 weeks ago we had a problem with the ice maker on our new GE profile refrigerator so I call a GE repair company who also repairs and warranties other manufacturers' products. They came out and fixed the ice maker and since their repairs are warrantied for 5 years, I asked them to look at the microwave. They also said it was the motor but they would not repair it because they have found these unit have a tendency to catch fire.<br /><br />Well, I will never by another Panasonic product EVER.

I use a microwave to heat leftovers, cook frozen meals, make popcorn, melt butter or cheese, thaw frozen meat, reheat cold coffee, freshen stale bread of make it into croutons, cook sausages and hot dogs etc. I use this microwave several times per day.  I think my microwave usage is pretty typical.  The only thing I don't do in the microwave is prepare entrees from scratch (like cooking a roast or casserole). I've cooked all sizes of frozen entrees with no issues. Note, my review refers to an earlier model of this machine, which seems identical to this one that has replaced it.<br /><br />(1) Form factor. Because the guts of the machine are under the cooking chamber, this has the smallest possible footprint.  And because of the rounded back, I have it tucked into a corner of the countertop. This means I lose only 1' of countertop, and furthermore it's an awkward part of the countertop I wouldn't use for prep work etc because my elbow would bang into the fridge. Every other microwave I've ever owned took up 2' of prime, useable countertop. This makes such a huge difference in the usability and appearance of the kitchen that I'd give it five stars for this reason alone.<br /><br />The interior size of this machine is bigger than you'd think because it's round and all the space is useable. The round turntable entirely fills the rounded shape of the interior. An advantage of this is that nothing falls off into the corners as it cooks. I've occasionally thawed something bigger then the turntable (the sides and front of the microwave are square so this is possible) and it wasn't a problem.<br /><br />(2) Controls. I love love love the simplicity of the controls. It does exactly everything I need it to do in a way that is completely intuitive and simple. I should mention I own an Emerson microwave in my office that I have never yet beenable to figure out how to operate (and I'm of at least normal intelligence). The hated Emerson has lots of buttons and I'm sure it does a lot of things I don't need, but none of that matters because I'm not willing to learn a complex and counterintuitive interface to cook a frozen lunch entree. This Whirlpool, however, is amazing.  It has Power, Defrost, Reheat and Popcorn buttons, as well as a Plus (+) and Minus (-) and a Start and a Stop. I accomplish everything with the Plus, Minus. Start and Stop, and occasionally Power.<br /><br />To operate, you can just press the Plus until you reach the time you want, then press Start. Bam. You can't get any easier than that. The time increments get larger as you increase time, and this is absolutely not a problem. It uses 5 second increments up to 2 minutes, then 15 second increments to 3 minutes, then 30 second increments up to six minutes, then one minute increments from there. This is fine; I've never had an issue where using 6 or 7 minutes instead of 6.5 minutes caused a meal to fail (my pot pies call for 6.5 minutes at 50% power, and they're fine at either 6 or 7.  When I make popcorn, I always listen to the popping and stop it when it slows. That's because popping times depend much more on the freshness and moisture content of the kernels than the power of the microwave; this is true of every microwave. Similarly, when I'm thawing something I pay attention to the progress of it because again, the fat content of the food and how hard it's frozen makes all the difference in timing. I suspect there are fancy convention microwaves with thermal probes that allow completely mindless use, but that kind of ultra high-end microwave isn't what I want or need.<br /><br />I've been using an earlier model of this microwave for three years with absolutely no problem. I can't speak to specific reliability of the model here, but mine is the same in layout of controls, form factor, etc, so I would not hesitate to buy this one. In factI'm very tempted to buy one of these for the office and get rid of that annoying Emerson once and for all.",12/14/2014,-1,1

It heats food quickly, is easy to use (once you review the manual), and can serve the same functions a microwave and toaster oven do.<br /><br />What makes this microwave different...<br />+ It has many possibilities.<br />+ Pizza is crispy on the bottom (when reheated) even on the microwave setting!<br />+ It can be simple, or you can dive into all the stuff it can do!<br />+ The size is comparable to our old 1.1 cu ft microwave, yet it can do more.<br />+ The colors are awesome!  The stainless is only on the front (which makes for less to clean) and the gray top and sides are not stainless---so they will keep cleaner.<br />+ The dials and quick microwave settings are smart.  To reheat something for 30 seconds, just press the button on the bottom right (once for 30 seconds, twice for a minute, etc.).  Or, press the microwave button, turn the dial to the time you'd like (backwards or forwards) and then press the start button.<br />+ The clock setting is easy to set.<br />+ The convection oven works for settings up to 400 degrees.  Preheat the oven first, and then select the convection oven.  You'll need to read the directions in the manual first, but then it's easy to navigate from there on out.<br />+ The oven includes a crispy plate, two wire racks (that worked great on the convection setting), a glass plate and ring.  I baked some cheese onto the plate while using the convection setting and it cleaned up super easy.<br /><br />What may concern you...<br />-  The microwave does need to be on a sufficiently powered circuit (not on a power cord).  It does not have a long cord, so you need to be able to place it right in front of the outlet you are going to use or close to it.<br />-  Don't use plastic plates that are not microwave safe.  One review for this microwave was mistaken--they said you couldn't use plastic in it.  Not true.  You just have to use microwave safe materials.  There's a thorough and easy to reference list in the manual (which is located inside the microwave oven when you unpack it).<br />- The oven does have a heating element on the top because it is a convection oven, so you will want to make sure you have a microwave safe plastic cover that you can use when you are microwaving.  Otherwise, it's going to be a pain to clean it up.<br /><br />Other matters to address...<br />It's always interesting to read other people's reviews.  One reviewer didn't like the manual, because a cookbook wasn't included.  Honestly, I've gotten so many cookbooks over the years with appliances and I've never used them.  The manual for this oven seems small, but it is packed with all the essential information you'll need to use it--and more.  No recipes, but all the guidelines for cooking vegetables, reheating foods, etc.  I don't cook in my microwave oven normally.  I did bake spinach artichoke dip in this oven, though, on 375 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly!<br /><br />Another reviewer lamented the lack of a timer on this microwave oven.  That's not true actually.  If you use the microwave function, the time counts down normally.  If you use the convection setting, you have to select how long you want the oven to cook for and then it will turn off automatically when it is done.  If you find you need a few extra minutes, it's very easy to turn it right back on.  To use the convection oven, you do need to preheat the oven first, but that's not a problem.  One feature that was awesome was that when I took my dish out of the oven to stir it, the oven did not start cooking again until I pressed the start button (so the time didn't keep going either).  Most people I know use the timers on their ovens or use a stand alone timer that they can take with them into another room if needed or move to where they will hear it when it goes off.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with this microwave.  It covers the basics and beyond very well!  I don't expect it to do everything--grill, slimfry, microwave, convection.  But, the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me!  Many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all.  I prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove, so I don't want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess.  I'm extremely happy with what I've used it for so far.ics and beyond very well!  I don't expect it to do everything--grill, slimfry, microwave, convection.

We love the microwave, but just can't handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair...typically down for a month due to delays in service calls, all parts having to be ordered, then waiting for tech to come back...and in many cases, waiting for them to order more parts.

Tech was onsite for approx 5 min, did little/no testing and decided to order AC Filter board (along with previously broken plastic components from earlier repairs)  12/24/2009 - Tech determined incorrect part (AC filter board) ordered, so placed order for 19 additional parts and left with no further action.  1/7/2010 - Replaced 19 parts - didn't fix original issue (Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running) and caused a new issue - exhaust fan not functioning - this was a 6 hour service call.  Six additional parts ordered - microwave left in pieces and not re-installed on wall.  1/14/10 - Tech replaced 6 additional parts (3 hr call), (LCD control board, upper front plastic frame, magnetron cooling fan, wiring harnesses).

Every appliance in our kitchen is new and this particular appliance is my favorite due to the uniqueness and convenience of this model. This microwave has exceeded our expectations in every way. One of the reasons we bought this microwave was that we needed a microwave that would fit under the countertop so our kids could reach it. It is also nice that the door slides open and I can reach down to lift out the food instead of having to reach up at face level and lift food out and down. I liked the unique concept of a drawer that pulls open instead of a door that pops open. I was a little concerned about reviews on earlier models that the auto open and close function on this microwave has a tendency to break. However, it seems that Sharp decided to manufacture this one so it closes with a button or by pushing or pulling on it to eliminate that problem. I was also concerned that it didn't have a piece in it that rotates the food. So, we were surprised to find that none of the food we have cooked has hotspots (note: I only use my microwave for reheating...not cooking). I LOVE this microwave. I had considered purchasing the 30 but decided that it was unlikely that I would need to put a dish in the microwave that was bigger than 24. So far, this has been the perfect size. It is even tall enough that I can put my portable mug in it to heat up my tea. Also, my lovely daughter did not know that you can't put metal in the microwave. She put her fork in with her plate. Surprisingly, the microwave did not arch. We checked the manual and it said you can even use aluminum foil to cover portions of meat. Not sure how they do it, but I'm not likely to try it. The microwave seems fine after the fork episode. This microwave also has programmable features such as softening ice cream. It asks what size of ice cream then sets the time as appropriate. It's a nice feature but I'm not usually softening a whole tub ofice cream. Just a portion of a tub. One other feature I use frequently, pushing the power button after closing the drawer will turn on the microwave in one minute increments. As an example, pushing the button 3 times will equate to 3 minutes. This is a pricey microwave but has been well worth the expense in our experience. I highly recommend this microwave!",10/29/2009,1,1

I don't see what could cause the loose fit. Nevertheless, the carousel does turn, just not very quietly.<br /><br />Otherwise, great buy. It is still easy to clean.

I loved the old one, even though it only lasted 9 years, but this one has been a tremendous disappointment.   First off, Amazon does not tell you until AFTER your purchase that they subcontract out delivery to a third party who prohibits you from speaking with the driver via his cellphone and thinks nothing of dropping the ball re customer communication: I wasted an entire day waiting for a delivery man who did not ring my bell as instructed and had instead delivered it to my super, which no one bothered to tell me. The delivery was an extremely frustrating fiasco.  Amazon needs to take more responsibility vis a vis decent delivery services.   Next point of disappointment:  I paid two men to install this monster.  (It's practically 80 lbs. and impossible to install solo).  So they get it in and fitting properly into the drop-in shelf designed to hold it. Then comes another surprise: Every time I turn it on, it makes a tremendous rattley racket not unlike a jet turbine - nothing at all like the smooth, quiet operation of its predecessor. This noise is so loud you can't even think about listening to NPR or a fellow kitchen occupant during the oven's operation. If I press firmly on the door of the microwave while it's on, the noise mutes, but who can stand in front of the microwave pressing on it every time you  zap a potato?  I'm not sure if the ace delivery company rattled something loose inside this particular appliance, or if this series model contains a design flaw, but the noise is really horrible.   There's more: I was very impressed with the ease of baking in this oven - the programming is  simple enough for a liberal arts major to grasp quite easily. But every time I use the convection function (closely following all the instructions re appropriate containers, elevating the foodstuffs off the rotating plate, etc.,) the oven gives off a menacing odor exactly like you sniff in a terrible electrical fire. There is nothing in the manual concerning either the noise issue or the smell issue.   I'm in NYC, where there are very few options when searching for a specific appliance (I tried to find one locally that would fit my shelf space), but if I could have, I would have previewed this model at a local retailer and seen how it worked there before springing for such an expensive lemon. Because this behemouth is such a hassle to remove and install, it's the kind of thing which, if you do buy it, you should buy with a guarantee of local on-site service. So far, this oven's cost me $1,000.",10/12/2008,-1,1

Then just over a year after the purchase date (when the builder bought all the appliances) the unit died.  No signs of life at all.  It had been in use for 3-4 months in total.  Microwaves have been around for a long time and most are pretty much bulletproof.  Not this one.  Reading the reviews it is obvious that Sharp has built a flawed product and is not standing behind it.  I have called them twice and asked about a product recall, and if they were going to escalate the product defect issues to their development team.  No response.  It's obvious that their customer service teams do not close the loop and provide feedback to their engineering and business teams.  For this price, this is an unbelievable rip off.  Yes it looks great, but it doesn't work much more than a year.  Now we're stuck, with the prospect of paying for service, and then waiting until it breaks again.  Since this is likely a low volume unit, the number of consumer complaints won't be adequate to force Sharp to own up to the obvious quality issues.",6/26/2013,1,1
