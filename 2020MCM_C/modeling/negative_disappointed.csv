So you're supposed to wash the animal in the washer, with the pasi attached to it, allowing any soap you might use in the washer to soak into the pasi.  Or you could not use any detergent but either way I'm sure the pasi can't be washed in a washer too frequently.<br /><br />You can't remove or reattach the pasi unless you take the stitch out and then restitch the (or a new) pasi into the mouth of the animal.  I was expecting some clip or tie or something else other than permanent attachment of the two objects; for cleaning purposes this is completely unpractical.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of just one because it is adorable. It is another baby-item that may or may-not work depending on how my child takes it.  The rating is not based upon if my kid throws it or not because that would defeat the purpose of rating the product as-it-is verses what my kid does with it.",3/13/2011,1,0

It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it. They really cheaped out and raised the price. I'm disappointed. Still a great product but not as pictured! I'd give this 4-stars now.",1/19/2012,1,1

I can understand once I look at it - like another reviewer mentioned, it can't be used on its side (like just activated and thrown in the diaper bag).  Because it has to be on a level surface, it's not really that great for using on the go unless you have time to wait - like at a coffee shop or restaurant, friend's house, etc.  According to my pal, those trips require so much packing anyway that an extra binky is a must, making this a little inconvenient.

I picked this up when my girl was about 3 mo on a whim having previously refused to spend so much on a binkie for my son when he was little or my new baby. Wow was I irritated with myself for not giving these a go 3 years ago. My daughter was 5 weeks premature and about 5 pounds, so small but not excessively so and the first 3 months we struggled to find her a binkie that would work as she had the tiniest mouth (so tiny that even the binkies for real preemies didn't fit her tiny mouth, tiny mouths are genetic in our family to begin with) so we tried everything available and as soon as we popped a binkie bear in her mouth and she snuggled the bear into her tiny arms I knew we had found magic. Due to some really serious heath complications from my pregnancy that had me bedridden and in and out of the hospital for the first 9 months of her life, it was imperative we find something she could sooth herself with and this product was a godsend. I'm not sure if they work for children under 3 mo who can't even partially grasp at objects but by that time she was able to sort of grab the plush part enough to cuddle it and this kept the pacifier portion in her mouth most of the time, plus it's so large that it's very difficult to lose tho not impossible I promise. The only downside is that the plush portion isn't machine washable, you can hand soak and disinfect but considering they spend so much time in babies mouth they get pretty nasty looking and matted and stiff after a few months even if their technically &#34;clean&#34;. However I can't imagine a reasonable design workaround that would allow the binkie to be attached but still washable so I can't hold that against the manufacturer. I'm a little disappointed that our local slave labor big box store stopped carrying them because they were only costing me about $6.99 and every place else charges at least twice thatplus shipping. It's still worth it to keep my daughter happy because she's miserable without one of these babies close by. She pretty much snubs her nose at any pacifier without an attached teddy bear now which put us in a real pickle last weekend when she lost ALL three during one infamous Ikea trip where she's was in a particularly gravity obsessed mood in the linens and no one seems to sell them brick and mortar since I last stocked up. I'm telling you, short of duct tape and a visit by child protective services, these pacifiers will a happy baby make and a happy baby is a happy mama (much like my happiness dictates my husband's sleeping arrangements). Trust me, these are THE binkie to have. And darn their cute too.",2/13/2015,1,0

It does start off rather cool, but it always heats up more about 30-60 seconds into blow drying. With as much power going through it, I don't think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair.<br /><br />3) Buttons! Yes, the buttons are on the side. I think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers. It takes some time to get used to a new one.

I can't easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I'm doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It's like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too.

I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  It worked fine and I had no complaints. I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  I didn't see any improvement in frizz when using the dryer. I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don't remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer wouldn't work.  I pushed the reset button on the plug and it wouldn't reset. I pushed the reset button on my outlet and it was working.  I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  The tag on the plug said I should refer to the user manual.   I found it on Conair's website but it was not helpful (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer). So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring. I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer. HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair's headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     I'm really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH) the dryer has stopped working.  I'm also disappointed that I have to go through a rigamarole to have the dryer replaced.  With today's technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer. They could also send me a prepaid shipping label and not charge me shipping and handling for a new dryer.      Maybe I just got a clunker, lots of folks like the dryer.  Just hope nothing goes wrong with it, or you'll be spending ten bucks to replace a 25 dollar dryer!",2/15/2011,1,1

It does have a nice long cord so I am able to move around more and not be confined in standing in one place. It does come with 2 attachments 1 nozzle is long and thin and the other is shorter and wider. It does have 3 heat selections (low, medium and high) and does have 2 speeds (gentle and strong).

As a frequent dry shampoo user, I have to say this one has the freshest shampoo-like scent and it really works without leaving a residue. The problem, which I am unable to overcome, is the issue with the sprayer getting clogged. Luckily, I bought my product from a local cosmetics shop and they allowed me to RETURN FOUR BOTTLES in a row. I tried hot water, I tried cleaning the nozzle. I never tried sticking an earring in it like another reviewer suggested, but I had enough. Probably because of their embarassment, one of the cosmetic store employees told me they had heard Ojan was improving their bottle. So I waited diligently for about a year before purchasing another bottle only to find that, just like before, after about 2 uses, the nozzle clogs.     DEAR OJAN - PLEASE IMPROVE YOUR PACKAGING DESIGN SO I CAN CONTINUE TO USE YOUR PRODUCT!!! It is a horrible design flaw that has to cost a ton of money in returns and in loss of potential return customers - LIKE ME!    Now I use Oscar Blandi's power, which is a fabulous product, but sprays are just a little better. I have heard similar reports in Blandi's spray and have avoided it as a result.

I used to spend a long time drying, only to end up with large & frizzy hair, and then spend even more time using a flat iron and my hair never even came near the smoothness & utter silkiness that using the Sedu Revolution has afforded me.

It's really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I'm sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it's a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it's an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made..

I was super disappointed given my glowing review below. I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer. I think that's about it.",2/1/2015,1,1

I don't think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many 'Top Ten Hair Dryer' lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what 'technologies' exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho' people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn't happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn't 'lock' but I don't care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can't believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference. I actually look forward to doing my hair now!

The 1 Micropore tape is absolutely the best solution I've found for taping orchestral music parts together.  It sticks just enough to hold the pages together perfectly, yet not so much that it can't be repositioned without destroying your parts.  It's extremely thin, easy to tear to length, folds perfectly, and doesn't stretch at all.  It's about as sticky as masking tape, but much thinner and much stronger.    I'm constantly being complimented on how my parts are bound, and it has everything to do with this tape!    Stop using Scotch or masking tape -- and buy this immediately.  You will not be disappointed!",12/4/2010,1,1

Problems I found with it were mostly concerning the sensor cooking being completely inaccurate. Some items cooked or were warmed too little and some were much too hot. It was easier to simply time it myself.    But the straw that broke the camel's back for me on this unit was how long it lasted. It simply quit heating last week after being 35 months old. Everything else works but nothing gets warmed or cooked, leading me to believe the magnetron went bad. The microwave comes with a one year parts and labor warranty and a ten year parts only warranty on the magnetron. In speaking to an authorized repair center for Samsung, I was told I would pay a $99 trip charge to determine what is wrong, and if it is the magnetron, an order would be placed with Samsung for the part which will take three to six weeks to arrive and then I would have to pay another trip charge and labor to R & R the magnetron. Bottom line - even with the magnetron warranty, it will cost me more than I paid for the microwave to repair it.    I have had several microwaves since 1978 when they became popular. I have never had one that lasted less than 10 years. When this one went bad last week, I pulled out a countertop model Sharp Carousel that I bought 15 years ago and am using it, still working perfectly. I went to Lowe's where I purchased the unit and told the salesman that I went all Samsung three years ago while remodeling my kitchen and am now worried about the other units, particularly the refrigerator because it is making noise that it shouldn't. He told me that he has had more complaints about Samsung microwaves than any other brand and any other kind of appliance, and the only kind of appliance that Samsung has not had numerous complaints on is their ranges.    I have had serious issues with Samsung's customer service in the past due to owning many of their electronics. If you read any reviews about their service after the sale, you will find it is virtually nonexistent. But I wrote an email to Samsung letting them know that in my opinion, a microwave should last longer than three years and am very disappointed with the product.

Other models require some extra space in front of the microwave on the left side, to be able to open the door. It is not a problem for most kitchens, but if you have a deep cabinet to the left of the microwave that extends in front of oven, Sharp seems like the only option. Sharp has put a smaller door that starts about an inch from the left side of the microwave, so it opens freely.    So far I was not disappointed. I'm mostly using the microwave mode, convectional mode. It cooks well, and the menu is rather intiutive - what else do you need? Auto reheat works well and produces consistently good results. I was not getting very good result with mixed mode (oven + microwave) though.    There are some faults in this model, that I think Sharp should've done better, so it only got 4 starts:  1) The menu system could be better. E.g. the Start button on most microwaves also serves as 'Add minute' or 'Add 30sec', but here it would not do anything - one has to use dedicated 'Add minute' button. I got used to it, but my guests can't easily find this button.  2) The fan is very very loud. It has two speeds, but even with reduced speed, it is very loud. It does not look extremely powerful either.  3) The range light is generated by two small incandescent bulbs. I would expect energy efficient fluorescent lamps or LEDs for this high-end oven. They could've perfectly fit a long tube there, but have instead put old unefficient incandescent bulbs.  4) The interior is stainless steeel, but it is not very smooth, so it takes some effort to clean the microwave.",10/13/2008,1,1

A lot of the reviews I have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges. Samsung (or whoever the Samsung dealer on here is) has only added to the confusion, unfortunately.<br /><br />First, a few points to set the record straight. The appliance is NOT covered in stainless steel. There may be a bit of it in the trim, but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn't actually sen one in person. Most of the outside has a black, textured metal finish, which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances. It may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though.<br /><br />There is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction, which is limited to the trim, &#34;open button&#34; and part of the door latch. I have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance. In fact, the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside. Some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode, which is not true. The rack can be used in the combination grill/microwave mode just fine and your microwave will NOT burst into flames. From the manual, page 11: &#34;Grill Rack, to be placed on the turntable. The metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking&#34;. It will even &#34;work&#34; in the microwave-only setting, although it won't contribute to the cooking process at all. In fact, the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave AND grill at the same time, and you can't utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place.<br /><br />This brings me to the main point of my review. Those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave. This is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison. Is it heavier than most stand-alone microwaves? Of course it is, because it has an entirely separate heating element, electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior. This is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta, pizza, crusts, etc. The additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than stand-alone microwaves, which is entirely understandable to me. This also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavy-duty microwaves. If used with the grill though, it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating.<br /><br />Adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of stand-alone microwaves on the market. The reason for this is pretty simple. To keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance. Without the heavy-duty (which is necessarily heavy) inside and outside finishes the device has, it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned. For those who wonder why it doesn't have more capacity or more wattage, the reasons all boil down to safety. You can only add so much shielding to keep the size (and cost) of such an appliance practical. I think that Samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety, size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does.<br /><br />In regards to cost, I have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks. At one point I believe it was $179 (shipping included). Then it went up to $230 (shipping NOT included). Today, it is down to $199.99 with free shipping. I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is, but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries, it seems like at bargain to me.<br /><br />For me personally, this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things. The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen, ever. It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone, actually. All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though, because it is definitely more expensive than a stand-alone microwave. If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill. I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though. I am too spoiled with this product's cooking ability at this point. In any event, I think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here. Try it for yourself and I would bet that you won't be disappointed.n to $199.99 with free shipping.
