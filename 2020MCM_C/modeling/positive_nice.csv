I had gotten this when my daughter was 3 months old and it is so nice that when she starts fussing, the pacifier doesn't fall out of her mouth completely.  She's holding on to mr toutou, so once she's done fussing, she just sucks on the pacifier without me needing to put it back in her mouth.  This is also great for car rides.  When she wakes up in the car, he's right there for her.  No need to scream or have mommy reach back to find a pacifier and put it in! She's almost 5 months now and after seeing how well it worked, I bought a backup- Elliot the elephant, a replacement pacifier and the soft teethers that attach (not a necessity yet, but she still enjoys the textures).  Everything is high quality.  I would recommend this over the other brands that don't detach from the stuffed animal because the pacifier part needs to be washed off a lot in our pet friendly home and I think its gross to put a pacifier in the washer/dryer.  It would get nicks and cracks in it much easier and common sense says that's where bacteria likes to live.  The pacifier itself is very similar to our advent soothie pacifier and I never worry about it being pulled off the stuffed animal by her- it's secured by three round nubbins that push in to a soft plastic on the dogs head.  Even if it did fall off, it's the same exact size as her soothie.  I really recommend this product and will be ordering one for each and every baby shower I attend!",12/3/2013,1,0

When we got the item we throughly inspected it and it is very well made. The plush part is well sewn with the fillings in several smaller self contained parts (i.e. the leg fillings can't pass on other parts of the body). It is light weight but not too light either, if you put it on the baby's belly it will stay there. The baby can lift it with no problems at all.<br /><br />The Soothie pacifier part is sewn into the plush so it won't come apart. It has a large ring with perforations so choke hazard is really none existent.<br /><br />My only complain (and this is why I didn't give it 5 starts and why I won't get another) is the pacifier part has a very small profile. Description says from 0 to 6 months but the tip does look like a new born Cicco pacifier in size and our baby is more used to the #2 orthopedic (flat) profile... so a bigger option for bigger babies would've been nice.<br /><br />It took our baby like 5 seconds to figure out what it was and she instantly and naturally took it from her belly and self inserted it in her mouth. Eventually when she doesn't want it anymore she takes it off and plays with it, speaks with it... it is very cute indeed.<br /><br />If my baby were smaller (say 1 - 3 months) I'd get at least 3 or 4 more.

I wasn't entirely sure which color would arrive but these are the ones I wanted.<br />The shape is ideal because as a BF mom it's important that it be very similar in shape and size for an easy transition back and forth. Our babies were always very picky about the shape, each one taking to different kinds. The first child only took the nipples that were flat on one side, while the second preferred the ones which are not, but rather like these - round all the way around. They are also long enough that they can stay in easy but still bulbous. These are thinner at the base than they are at the tip, unlike the hospital issued ones which are the same size all the way from base to bulb. Those tend to pop straight out of the babies mouth where these stay in and are a more natural fit for them. They are the litle handles to attach to a ribbon holder so they stay within reach and being clear they will never chip or peel like some of the plastic ones. The silicone material is easy to clean and disinfect and I would definitely recommend these as a gift or necessity buy for another little one.<br />I purchased this set at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions expressed are my own.",6/2/2015,1,0

They may not suit everyone's taste, however.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the largest size (12 month+) has a very large bulb at the end.

We bought small packs of three different types of pacifiers to see what our baby would prefer.  We bought Dr Brown's Prevent, Nuk, and Avent.  Our baby will LOVES the Dr Brown pacifiers.  She'll put up with the Avent ones, but they pop out of her mouth so easily it's hardly worth it.  The Nuk ones get spit out almost instantly, they're too hard to keep in her mouth.  These ones have a fantastic shape that is very well designed.  I love that it doesn't give her gas because she's not sucking any air.  These are just so perfectly designed and we've already bought more for her.  I think it's good advice to try different pacifiers for your baby because all babies are different, but I will say that these ones definitely stay in their mouths better no matter who your baby is - so I won't tell you not to try different pacifiers at first, but definitely include these when you're trying a few out!  They'll probably become a quick favorite for you and baby.<br /><br />Originally we purchased the Dr Browns Prevent pacifiers from another Amazon listing where Colors may vary and there are no handles on the pacifier.  We ended up with blue and red, which I didn't love for our little girl.  It's silly and not important, but I didn't love having her suck on a blue or red pacifier when she was always dressed in pink or purple.  These pacifiers are much preferred!  Though they're the same shape for sucking, there are a few differences.  The silly difference (but it matters to me!) of the color is the obvious difference.  Another key difference is these ones also have the handles on them and the others don't.  I have found that I much prefer the handles for multiple reasons.  One, they are easy to hold if I'm burping her and just want to have the pacifier handy for when she's done and ready for it.  Two, if I drop the pacifier, the extra weight from the handle makes it land on the back almost every time so the nipple doesn't get dirty.  Three, if you're attaching a pacifier clip, it can attach to the handle instead of the opening on the part of the pacifier that touches the baby's face.  Our pacifier clip was always rubbing against our baby's face when using the other ones and I didn't like that since it left a red mark on her cheek.<br />Another difference is that these pacifiers actually come with a clip-on nipple cover.  I LOVE this accessory because if I'm running to a neighbor's house for a short visit and I don't need to tote a whole diaper bag, but I do want to bring a pacifier - I easily can with the clip cover.  It works so great to just clip the cover on so I can throw the pacifier in my pocket without it getting all nasty.  Or it's nice for putting in the diaper bag without getting gross as well.<br /><br />The price is about the same (within a dollar) of the other colors may vary listing, so these ones are the clear winner between the two listings.  If you want a great pacifier for your little girl, these are PERFECT!",4/9/2013,1,0

And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.<br /><br />However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:<br />- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.<br />- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.<br />- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!<br /><br />Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby.

It is machine washable and as soon as you take it out, it does not really need to be dried as it is dried already and is ready to be used.<br />I thought it was a bigger giraffe and was disappointed at first to see it so tiny, but I believe it is the appropriate size for an infant not to choke on. It is a pricey ($13-$14 ea.). Wish it was half price, and wish I could replace pacifiers on the stuffed animal, but can not, since it is sewed with stitches to the giraffe.<br /><br />BabyHaven is really professional and nice. When I received other regular Soothie pacifiers in damaged boxes, they offered to send me replacements for free. Hoping to receive them soon by mail.<br />----------------------------------------<br />Edited April 8, 2013:<br />I now have an Amazon Prime Membership with my Amazon Mom membership, I receive everything in 2 days and can return items with no hassle. Back when I bought the Wubbanub and Avent Soothie Pacifiers from BabyHaven, I thought they proposed to send me free pacifiers to replace the damaged packages I received but they did not and wanted me to pay for the return shipping rate. They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care.<br />They were not so professional what so ever.<br /><br />We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping.<br /><br />Would still recommend the product though. My daughter stopped taking the pacifier around 4 months, but she loves to play with the tiny stuffed animal and chew on it sometimes :) So cute!",12/21/2012,1,0

So after buying so many others I bought those ones hoping they would do the trick (when she was about 7 months).<br />Well it is perfect! They are of hard but yet soft plastic so no fear of her breaking them, they have a little handle with a hole so I use a paci holder, they are the exact same size as the gumdrop we got from the hospital.<br />They are great for breastfed babies from my experience, as they reproduce the nipple quite nicely.<br />They do not leave marks on the baby face while sucking on them, and fall of the mouth easily when they stop sucking - i like that as compared to some others that they keep the whole time even after they passed out.<br />So far I have still been using the same one for the past 2 months so they are durable.<br />They also wash well : dishwasher or mild soap, the water does not get stocked into it so I feel it is healthier/cleaner than other ones.<br />Overall very satisfied",7/1/2014,1,1

Well, now that I have them, I cannot imagine life with out them!

When my son accidentally spits out the pacifier, instead of it bouncing off of him to who-knows-where, it stays in practically the same spot, just below his chin, provided he does not knock the stuffed animal out of the way.  I like this system better than any pacifier clips I've used because with the clips, he'll spit out the pacifier, and although it is still attached to him, it will likely drop to his side and far from his mouth.

I thought they were just stuffed animals attached to pacifiers.  I didn't realize I needed one until I was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier.  Quickly, I ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier.  It took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and I immediately cleaned it and put it to use.  It works great.  My two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired (despite my best efforts for naps) to help her settle down.  I haven't used it in the car yet, which is where I need it most, but I'm sure it'll be great.  It's nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort.<br /><br />The only downfall I see with the design of the product is that you can't take the paci off to really clean it.  Yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and I did that.  I just wish I could run it through my dishwasher like I do the other things to make sure it's really sterilized.  But, then I'm kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one.  Definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter's tiny hands can really grab onto it.  She seems to like the soft feel.  The little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing.  The pacifier is sewn into the stuffed animal part so there is no worry about fingers or anything getting caught in a loop or something like that.  The fabrics are bright and cute.

The little lamb (and it is little) is precious and you can't help but say awww when you first see it.  It's a great concept, and any parent that has played the retrieve the binky game is hoping it will work.  So far for us it's been about 50% successful.  The little lamb's feet are slightly weighted, so if our daughter is lying still in her rumble chair and you get the binky in her mouth and the lamb spread out right it does work.  The problem is at 11 weeks she's not exactly lying still all that often but she doesn't have the hand control to hold on to the lamb.  She still has the whole arms-swinging-wildly startle reflex going, so more often than not she knocks the lamb, which pops the binky out of her mouth, defeating the whole purpose.  She can't control her hands enough yet to then get it back in.<br /><br />On the upside, it does prevent the binky from rolling off onto the floor and it makes it much easier to find and put back in her mouth.  I can see the potential for this product and hope when she gets older and can actually hold on to the lamb it will work.  I'm giving it a 3 star rating for now for cuteness and potential and hope to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star rating in the future.<br /><br />Update: A year later and I'm afraid this little lamb never really worked out for us.  By the time my daughter had enough hand control to no knock the lamb out she was keeping a binky in her mouth more readily and she would grab this little guy to examine and again, pull the binky out of her mouth.  We ended up using binky leashes, which were perfect for our needs.  She recently rediscovered this little guy, and while she's too big to need him, she did enjoy popping the binky in and out of her mouth a few times holding the lamb, but then became angry that the lamb wouldn't give up his prize. =)  At this point, this guy is holding on to one star from us for sheer cuteness and one for what COULD be a great idea for another child, but I'm afraid he never quite worked out for us.  (We have friends who swear by him however, so it may work for your child.)<br /><br />As a note: it would be nice if there was some way to attach and detach the binky.  If she had used this frequently I could see it getting dirty and needing to be washed, which would be tricky without getting laundry detergent on the binky.  On the reverse side, you would want to wash the binky with dish soap but not the lamb.  The only decent solution is to handwash, and what busy parent has time for that?  (Plus at my daughter's current age I could see her loving to carry this little guy around if she could get the binky out of his mouth and it would have been nice to have given the toy a second life.)",12/31/2011,1,0

 with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!

I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.<br /><br />Here's what we like:<br /> - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.<br /> - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!<br /> - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).<br /> - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.<br /><br />Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.<br /><br />The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!! We've bought 5 packs over a couple of months and received: 3 red/blue, 1 green/teal, and 1 pink/purple. I'll likely save the pink/purple for a gift- or in case or pacifier emergency!",1/11/2014,1,1

 because of the metal legs that have to be attached and then that darn strap belt.<br /><br />the safety first bedrail is about four inches shorter than the regalo length wise, which isn't an issue for me.  the safety first is much shorter in height than the regalo, which i thought would be an issue but it isn't.  my son can climb over it when he's awake which isn't safe, but he doesn't thrash about where he would be lifted enough to fall over in his sleep.<br /><br />installing the safety first into the bed is so easy.  you just life the mattress and slide the legs under.  they have rubber grips on them so the legs don't slide out.  then you push the top of the tails down to snap them onto the mattress where you want them.  i had them too right at first and you just push the back buttons to release some of the tension.  one of our regalos lives on our master king bed for when the little one snuggles or falls asleep with us.  i can not tell you how hard it is to get the darn belt into the center under the mattress.  are the belts safer?  not in my opinion.  i have to tighten it all the time.  but the regalo is higher so that is nicer with the king size mattress.  so that being said, the safety first is a much easier install.<br /><br />with the safety first you lose about four inches of bed width because the rail is locked onto the mattress rather than the regalo that is on the side of the mattress.  i don't mind losing the bed space because there are no cracks for my little one to fall through.<br /><br />the safety first does not budge.  once locked on, i have pushed and pulled and that sucker is strong.  with the regalo i always have a crack that i have to wedge a pillow into so that my little one doesn't slip into it.  and he can push it pretty far out.  so annoying.<br /><br />making the beds.  the regalo stays on the king mattress when changing sheets but it's a pain.  it doesn't fold down like it's supposed to anymore so i have to work around it.  the safety first is so light and easy i take it off to change sheets.<br /><br />travel!  so my second regalo has been modified by me, regardless of safety warnings.  i wanted a bed rail for hotels and grandmas and the regalo was not like my old school one that just slid into the bed.  so i chopped off the belt and tossed it and my dad welded the bar to the legs.  it's clunky, but it works.  i know i'm not supposed to do that btw.  anyways, now i'm excited for our next trip to take this light weight, super easy no belt rail.  yeah!<br /><br />so yes, i like this product.  we have two beds that are just a mattress on a wood frame and it fits on them easily.  i don't have a pillow top so i'm not sure how it works on those.  i do have two memory foam mattresses that it works well on too.  you have to be careful not to make it too tight on the memory foam because these suckers can squeeze. with the regalo i had issues with the wood framed beds, it didn't fit into the wedges on both sides.<br /><br />also, please note this is just one bedrail.  but you could get one for each side if needed.<br /><br />rereading this i sound like a regalo hater and that's not entirely true.  like i said, they are longer and higher and are on the outside of the bed, so they are just a different type of rail.  for me personally i prefer the bedrails without the straps.with the regalo i always have a crack that i have to wedge a pillow into so that my little one doesn't slip into it.  and he can push it pretty far out.  so annoying.<br /><br />making the beds.  the regalo stays on the king mattress when changing sheets but it's a pain.  it doesn't fold down like it's supposed to anymore so i have to work around it.  the safety first is so light and easy i take it off to change sheets.<br /><br />travel!  so my second regalo has been modified by me, regardless of safety warnings.  i wanted a bed rail for hotels and grandmas and the regalo was not like my old school one that just slid into the bed.  so i chopped off the belt and tossed it and my dad welded the bar to the legs.  it's clunky, but it works.  i know i'm not supposed to do that btw.  anyways, now i'm excited for our next trip to take this light weight, super easy no belt rail.  yeah!<br /><br />so yes, i like this product.  we have two beds that are just a mattress on a wood frame and it fits on them easily.  i don't have a pillow top so i'm not sure how it works on those.  i do have two memory foam mattresses that it works well on too.  you have to be careful not to make it too tight on the memory foam because these suckers can squeeze. with the regalo i had issues with the wood framed beds, it didn't fit into the wedges on both sides.<br /><br />also, please note this is just one bedrail.  but you could get one for each side if needed.<br /><br />rereading this i sound like a regalo hater and that's not entirely true.  like i said, they are longer and higher and are on the outside of the bed, so they are just a different type of rail.  for me personally i prefer the bedrails without the straps.",10/7/2014,-1,0

Because it has to be on a level surface, it's not really that great for using on the go unless you have time to wait - like at a coffee shop or restaurant, friend's house, etc.  According to my pal, those trips require so much packing anyway that an extra binky is a must, making this a little inconvenient.

I thought it would help him learn to put it back in as well as be weighty enough to lay on his chest in just the right spot - so if he fell asleep he could pop it back in himself. And - believe it or not - it did all those things. HOWEVER - my son totally hated the pacifier. We had been using every brand of binkies, so I figured what's another new brand? Right? WRONG! We had used nuks, playtex, avent, etc. All with no problem but the soothie pacifier attached to this wubbanub is HUGE. I am not kidding. Not just huge on the outside plastered on your little one's face...but huge like a giant long nipple too! Coupled with the fact it was ugly as sin it made for hilarity at starbucks one day when all the other mommies watched in horror as I proudly pulled out my new fancy wubba to give to my little one and he proceeded to choke like a bulimic after thanksgiving. AND, the poor little dude kept giving it the old college try because he wanted the sucker and I let him because I forgot back up. I just kept praying he'd make it work. It was all very sad. Long story much shorter I sent my hubby to babies r' us to pick up as many small stuffed animals as he could find. That weekend I bought velcro and we created our own wubanubs. Here are 3 major benifits to making your own:<br />1) you can detach the pacifier and wash it for REAL. As well as wash the buddy it is attached too! Unlike the wubba. IMPORTANT - The wubbanub DOES NOT come apart ( very gross and stupid)<br />2) you can use whatever brand of pacifier your little one enjoys, a major plus if you actually want this whole learn your paci is attached to a frog thing to work.<br />and<br />3) Compared to the ugly things my little macgyvered knock offs look amazing. AND THAT should tell you something about how hideous these actually are. (Seriously, I am far from ambitious. I don't scrapbook, paint, or even cook anything that requires anything more then buttons on the microwave - so if you do - yours will probably be even more fantastically superior to these little nightmares)<br /><br />I have to say one nice thing though.

He has never had an issue keeping these in his mouth because there is nothing pushing against his nose when he sucks, and because of the contoured shape.    Now I will say that it would be nice if the entire pacifier was solid silicone like the Soothise pacifier is.  I had 2 of the Gum Drop pacifiers begin to peel away along the inside where the internal hard plastic form is.  I contacted the seller who directed me to the Manufacturer.  They were more than appologetic and sent replacements and also a return envelope for the damaged pacifiers.  They seemed genuinely shocked that this had happened to 2 of my pacifiers.  Despite this issue with a few of the GumDrop pacifiers, I still think they are an excellent product.

It fits very nicely, with no gaps, but I was a little put off by the material.  We have a firm crib mattress from Da Vinci at home, and this mattress seemed much more firm.  It's also covered in plastic, not fabric; although it's nice not to need a waterproof mattress pad, it winds up being very noisy if your baby moves, rustling the sheet against the plastic.  I would have preferred a fabric cover, and either buying a waterproof pad myself if I was using the mattress a lot, or just forgoing it and risking ruining the mattress, since it's fairly inexpensive and we were only using it for a short time.<br /><br />I know these aren't huge issues, but the bottom line is that my baby did not sleep well on it, and since we were in the same room, neither did we.  She adjusted quickly to the new surroundings and napped just fine in her usual Rock 'n Play, so I don't think it was just the fact that we were traveling.  She fidgeted the entire night (which kept us up all night with the rustling on the plastic!) and woke up much more frequently.  It was, however, an improvement over the 'mattress' that comes with the Pack 'n Play, and for the price, I am glad that we purchased it.  If you are using the Pack 'n Play as a primary place for sleeping, though, I would try to find something more like a regular crib mattress.",1/3/2013,-1,0

I decided to give this one a try, hoping that maybe if the paci fell out, it would still stay close enough for her to get back in her mouth on her own.  No such luck.  Also, when she starts vigorously sucking, she gets all excited and starts to pull on the animal, causing the paci to come out.  My sister had one of these with her DS a couple years ago, but I remember the animal being a little more weighted than this pink bear... per another reviewer, perhaps the quality has changed a bit over the years?<br /><br />The nice things about this paci is that it's cute as heck.  Also, when the paci does fall out of her mouth, it doesn't go too far - a problem I had with the paci alone falling on the floor and then me needing a few backups on hand in case I couldn't wash it right away.  I think this would be great for on the go - less likely for this bigger thing to fall out of the carseat (I don't think I quite trust a paci leash with my DD being this little).<br /><br />The one thing I don't like about this is that you can't remove the paci from the animal, so it makes washing a little tricky.  I'm used to having to sterilize everything daily for a preemie and this one you can't really throw in the dishwasher or in the steam basket.  The only way to sterilize is to dip it in boiling water and trying not to get the animal wet.  Based on reviews, doesn't sound like a good idea to throw this guy in the washing machine.  Plus, I'm not sure if I would want my DD's paci in the washing machine anyways.<br /><br />I am hoping as she gets a little bigger and if we decide to stick with a paci, that this will work out better for us.

I include an actual demo of its use in a dark room, stepping outside, and turning the lights off. It works exactly as advertised. The Foscam FBM2307 is NOT meant to be a high end, internet monitoring, SD card recording, remote controlled pan and tilt baby monitor. It has NONE of those features by design. There is no SD slot, there is no USB slot. By design. If you want those features, just look elsewhere. But as an excellent stand-alone baby monitor (or cat monitor, or front desk monitor) this works fine. I found the range to be outstanding - I left it in my office and made it about 200 feet away and down the stairs before the monitor lost contact with the camera (YMMV). Also, the clarity of the video and sound monitoring gave me nothing to complain about. This would be easy to throw in a bag or purse and take with you when you're travelling. It comes with two individual power supplies for the camera (which MUST be plugged in) and the monitor (which has a rechargeable battery and can be used remotely, but CAN be used plugged in).

What attracted me to this Andis was the &#34;salon grade&#34; and the ionic/ceramic attributes. Overall this is a good hair dryer, but it doesn't blow as hard as the Conair it replaced. This was HUGE for me, as I like a good air flow. It takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it, so we went back to our old brand. It does, however, leave your hair &#34;silkier&#34; which was a surprise to me. I didn't think an ionic dryer could do that, but it does. The two settings it has for wattage didn't seem to make much of a difference, but it's a nice touch. I'm sure there's a reason for the option, but I can't think of anything it's useful for. I put it on the high setting and let it go. The retractable cord is nice, but it doesn't reel the cord all the way in, leaving about 16in left dangling. After a few weeks of use, it reels in even less, now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging.<br /><br />Pro: Silky hair, somewhat retractable cord, two wattage settings (that I'll prob never use).<br />Con: Takes longer to dry long, thick hair as the air current isn't as strong as I'd like.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it, but if you don't mind a slightly weaker air flow, the ionic silkiness is worth it.",4/8/2015,1,1

On the second try, it got hot for about 5 seconds.... and then went cool again.  Third try - no heat.  I am glad I kept the box so I can send it back for my replacement.    So I am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element.  I still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air, and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design.  It blows really hard, which is what I like.  I also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when I don't want to straighten it (or when it's humid outside).  It's ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip.  I hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars!

Now that the heating element is working, I am able to see that the heat settings are just what I want, cool is cool, medium is my favorite for regular use, and hot is good and hot but not scorching (I might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers).

The main reason that I purchased this dryer was its price, practicality and its brand. Andis is one of the leaders in professional clippers in the hair industry, so I figured that I would give this dryer a shot. I have fine/normal curly just to about the ears, and this dryer gets it QUITE straight.I must admit that the &#34;high velocity&#34; air speed is not there, however, The HEAT is REALLY intense. As a professional, if I had to compare this to a standard salon dryer, performance wise, I would say that it acts a lot like the original Chi dryers, low speed, INTENSE heat, with ionic coating to break water molecules up faster. Now, that being said, if someone wants a dryer that really BLOWS the water out of the hair, I would recommend, concerning affordability and professional performance, the Babyliss 2800,  not that weighty and TRULY cuts drying time, in half, has a 3 year warranty AND Amazon sells it for half the retail price .<br /><br />This little Andis dryer works great for hair shorter than top of the shoulders, if you have really thick/curly or long hair, I would recommend use a T parting in your hair (draw a straight line with a wide toothed comb from the center of your eyebrows, to the back of your neck and comb each section down, from the very top of your head, draw a line from ear to ear to make a lower case 't' on your head) and do your hair in quadrants, (clipping them with butterfly clamps helps to keep other sections out of your way) 3-5 min extra prep time, but works WONDERS for straightening effectively, and saves you time in the end.<br /><br />This dryer does exactly what it says, it 'styles' hair, quite nicely might I add.The attachments are better than other vertical dryers that I have owned.The brush attachment is boar bristle, which allows one to naturally distribute oil through the hair, which is essential to a less frizzy and smoother blow dry. For those who have coarse, thick,tightly curled, or all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will 'mold' your hair. Air cool the section that you are working on,The cool shot button on ANY dryer is almost useless, takes too long to cool, by the time it does, the section that you are working on is practically almost ready and is 'set'.<br />Overall, this is a four star dryer, it comes with a FIVE year warranty, it's very hot, and it is great for people (like me) who suffer from carp-tunnel and arthritis in their hands. At under twenty dollars, this is a great deal, it is nearly impossible to find one locally at that price, especially with a professional brand backing it. Thanks again Amazon, I find SO much great stuff here!r all of the above, use the comb attachment that best suits you, and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go, this will 'mold' your hair.

It looks very nice! It鈥檚 powerful at 2200 watts. This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it's also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color.

The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and style.<br /><br />I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish. This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways. If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don't care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer. With my medium-fine hair, I just can't get that polished set that I'm looking for. My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I'm planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry. However, I don't like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished. If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer.

I used it twice, it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush.  I was pleased with the results, after all this was a big step up from the half broken one I purchased from Sally's years ago.  Then I visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier, the rusk w8less.  She told me I should try it.  When I used the rusk I was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt.  I was in LOVE!!! It was a huge step up from the twinturbo.  I had to have the rusk, so I returned the twinturbo.  I could not be happier w the customer service.  Refund was super smooth.

I was looking for something inexpensive and high quality, which often doesn't go together.<br /><br />The good: For the most part, this dryer does exactly what it says it will. It dried my hair slightly faster than my previous dryer, and left it frizz free. I have very fine hair, so it almost always gets poofy. The tapered end made it easier to target the air to the rolling brush, which makes a big difference when compared to a snub nosed dryer (those aren't professional beauty terms, just the best words I can think of to describe the product). It's a decent size and easy to store. The motor is VERY quiet compared to other hair dryers I've used. My boyfriend gets up an hour later than I do for work, and he definitely appreciates the quiet motor.<br /><br />The bad: Just an aesthetic thing, it smells weird. To be fair, it's brand new so it's probably the smell from the packaging; but it also produces a faint odor when the motor runs that reminds me of like a toy blow dryer. I'll update the review if the smell goes away. For it's average size, it's fairly heavy. I'm not sure if it's because a larger motor, heavier materials, etc. I was using it for about 10 mins and my arm started to get sore! It's not insanely heavy, definitely manageable, but I would give it a higher ranking if it was a lighter and easier to hold. Also, the controls operate opposite any dryer I've ever had. So, instead of sliding the control up to get a faster speed or hotter temp, you slide down. That has definitely taken some getting used to. Finally, the attachments are just OK. They connect to the dryer well, but if you're like me, you are kind of a klutz when blow drying your hair. I usually knock the dryer with my brush or my hand at some point during the drying process and the attachments fall off at the slightest bump.<br /><br />Overall - it does what it says it will and does fine for what I paid for it.

I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).<br /><br />One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn't believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).<br /><br />After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).<br /><br />Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter's and mother's hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.<br /><br />The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime. For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always.

I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.<br /><br />This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).<br /><br />I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic.

The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review). The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I've owned including the Andis model. I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers. The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair. There are 2 heat settings (low & high) and a cool setting. The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all). The air intake on the back is a 1-3/4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen. The opening is a bit small when compared to the Andis model which is larger at 2-3/8 inches and has side air intakes as well. This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor. Only time will tell. The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility. The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models. Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory. The retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet + 3 inches with 5-1/2 inches that does not retract into the handle. The retracter is a bit stronger than the Andis model but it will still require you to help feed the cord all the way to its end. The dryer does come with a 3 year warranty but the Andis model comes with a generous 5 year warranty. Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.

Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.

If you travel a lot you know that 2 lbs added to your suitcase can make a big difference. Even lugging this thing to the gym everyday would be a work out.

I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price.

The amount of 'hair static' effect seems reduced vs. my previous hairdryer.  The unit is a bit heavier than I expected, but the weight is balanced so handling is fine.  It's quieter than I expected even at full speed.  The cord is longer than needed in my personal situation, I find a cord that long just gets in the way.  The cord is straight, not coiled.  The big block thing at the end of the cord (vs. just an AC power plug) I find a nuisance since my power outlets are already GFCI-type outlets. Basic controls are fan & heat: 2 fan speeds + off & 2 temperatures + off.  The number of temperature settings advertized is a bit misleading - (&#34;4 temperatures&#34; is actually achieved by a combination of temperature switch & fan switch settings.)  Instructions (for English anyway) are generally lacking, but with a bit of experimentation one can figure out how to work it.  I rate the dryer 4 stars primarily for these reasons:  The &#34;Removeable stainless filter&#34; is a nice feature so hair clogs on the inlet can be removed, but getting it all back in place is not easy, it takes careful manipulation because the parts are not finely fitted and they bind easily (at least on my unit.)  Because of the binding and poor fit, I was afraid of breaking something in the precess of putting it back together after cleaning the filter.  The ad says: &#34;Includes concentrator&#34; - I assume this is supposed to be an attachment to put on the nozzle, my unit did NOT come with any extra parts.  All things considered I think it's overpriced and in some ways the ad is misleading.  I do intend to keep it, but will shop around again if I ever need another.",5/13/2013,-1,1

This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.

Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides. This in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air.  The cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out.  I love that it's intended to last 4 years!  One thing I did notice is that you aren't supposed to store it in a damp area so I keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed.

I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.

Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!

Second purchase of this model.  First one lasted a few years until the cord didn't retract, and then something came loose and smelled chemically acrid.<br /><br />It moves air and dries fairly well.  No particular change in frizz-level compared to others.<br /><br />Temps are spot on with me; it's nice to know I won't get burned nor be frustrated by a too-cool warm.<br /><br />I've gotten out of the habit of electric drying both for ecological reasons and for noise/hearing damage.  The only person really bothered by my wet hair or the results if nature-dried is me.  I don't find it any louder than any of my previous dryers, but my DD hates it with a passion. I'm thinking about using it as punishment (not really, but I probably could).  I don't get it, though. That's how hair dryers sound.  She winced at a 1200W mini, too.<br /><br />My cord retracts just fine, not like a shade, but I'm glad to have the heftier/safer cord without a vicious, finger-eating spring.  it took hundreds of in-and-outs for my old one to give out.<br /><br />The switches could have benefited mightily with even a slightly a concave dragging surface.  This strikes me as an efficiency design that wasn't.  It's not intolerable, though.

It's *great* (grippable) if you don't always use the handle (like when the handle is folded in).  That said, it's not makeup-friendly, or rather, it is.  Oily pigmented stuff shows up on this and can be hard to get really clean. 90% rubbing alcohol does the trick.  I still love it.<br /><br />My attachments stay on, tightly. (Save the rubber bands from your broccoli and wrap them around the dryer exhaust to increase its diameter.  Cram-like-heck the attachments onto the dryer.

As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me. I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home and it's very much a matter of if it's there I'll use it; if it isn't, then that's what a towel is for.<br /><br />The Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise. The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped. It looks good and feels good. I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls. Most of the features go way beyond my needs. I still don't know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good. The Mangroomer meets my basic needs in this regard.<br /><br />The slightly higher than average price doesn't seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars. It is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness. I did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer.

There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.

It drives me crazy that manufacturers include OFF as a fan speed when in my mind, off is the lack of speed.<br /><br />Anyway, this hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for. I've been using it for a couple weeks now. I wanted to get some uses under my belt before I wrote a review. The review is long but I'm trying to cover all the topics.<br /><br />Fan Speeds:<br />High: It's a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room. I'd compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer.<br />Med: FINALLY!!! A real medium speed. I have very fine hair. It was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket. The medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it.<br />Low: A reasonable low speed. Good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing.<br /><br />Heat Settings:<br />High: Certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying.<br />Med: This is the setting I use most. It has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged.<br />Low: Nice to use for curls or a slower, more refined dry style.<br /><br />Noise level: Much quieter than I thought it would be. I have some more expensive dryers that I'd like to wear ear plugs with. Even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound.<br /><br />Buttons/Controls: Some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments. Are they stiff? A bit. But honestly, I'd rather them that way. The slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it. In my opinion, they need to be stiff so you don't move them accidentally when you are using the dryer. Nothing I hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident. I have arthritis in my hands and fingers but I don't find the slides hard to move. It just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down. The cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to.<br /><br />Attachments: It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment. Both function quite well. They snap in, so no falling off while you're using them. The push buttons used to detach are easy to push.<br /><br />As a whole:<br />This dryer is a fantastic buy! I'm going to order another one to keep as a back up. The cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it. The 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be. It doesn't get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won't blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book. The color seems pretty close to what is pictured on Amazon's site; it's nice, but I really didn't buy it for looks. It dries hair quickly and without causing frizz. There was no buyers remorse with this guy. It was well worth the time I spent looking and well worth the money I paid.switch to high and blast myself on accident.

I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.<br /><br />Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy.

I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place.

The dryer has a nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap, but isn't overly cumbersome either. It dries my hair very well, and seems to keep frizz to a minimum thanks to it's lower heat and air settings. The dryer definitely makes noise on high, but it's not as loud as most I've encountered, so for me it's a non-issue. The attachments included seem to stay put for me, I've had no problems with them falling off or coming loose while using the dryer. The switches have a solid feel to them, are well placed too, reducing the chance of accidentally changing the settings.     One difference I've noticed compared to other dryers I've used is when changing the heat settings on this dryer, the fan motor doesn't speed up or slow down any at all. With other dryers if you turn the heat up the fan sounds like it slows some, and turn the heat down the fan sounds like it speeds up a little. Perhaps that is one of the advantages of having an AC fan motor instead of a DC motor that is wired into the heating elements via a rectifier circuit in the hair dryer, less stress and voltage spikes/sags to shorten the life of the fan motor.    The only issues I could think of is the cord is not as long as I'd like it to be. Another 2 or 3 feet of length in the power cord would make a huge difference for the better.     The low heat setting on the dryer seems to be cooler than the low heat setting on all the other dryers I've used i.e. it's barely warmer than ambient air temperature. Whether that's a plus or a minus should be left up to the individual user. For me, it works better this way, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.",5/7/2009,1,1

This one is the nice true compact type I like.  It also has decent quality of wire (some of that cheap wire nowadays hardly bends), and the cord is a generous 6 feet. The long cord is also a big selling point since a lot of the newer dryers have 4 foot cords.  I cannot comment on the international power settings since this will probably only be used in North America.  It does have 2 separate blowing speeds. The high speed is good, but my older dryer is just a little more powerful.  However, this one is good enough and the controls are set up for easy one-handed usage, with high, then &#34;off&#34; then &#34;low&#34; all on one simple power button. My hands are arthritic and this is much easier button placement than having the buttons on the front of the handle.  Also has a hanging loop as shown in the photo and I will be using that rather than folding the cord up after each use to store it.  Overall, this feels like a high quality product and over the past month or so I have used it, has been excellent.

Unlike the Revlon Rvdr5033 I had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan.  It gets very hot on high and so did the Revlon.  Too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore.  I could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact.  Not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a GFI and AC plug as part of that block.  Even though they tell you not to put two GFI's on the same circuit and there hasn't been a house built in almost 40 years without a GFI covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists.  I like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning.  Not many of the compact models seem to have that feature.  Overall a good unit.  Time will tell how durable and long lasting it is.  I can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced.  Update 7/21/15: Well it is NOT very long lasting.

My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back. Unfortunately, I bought back then what I thought was a better more economical option: an Andis Ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle. While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that's taking my time.

The Remington AC2015 does its job nice and quickly.<br /><br />I have long (almost waist length), thick, and very straight hair. I wash them every 2-3 days using natural products (Lush shampoo and conditioner), and also oil them a couple times a week (Jojoba oil + either rosemary or lavender essential oil). I use a wooden brush - but only when they're dry. So yes, I really love and care for my hair! But when it comes to drying them, I can't imagine to spend a lot of time doing it. My drying routine is simple: 1) I remove most of the water with a towel (gently) and use my fingers to remove tangles; 2) then I blow-dry my hair upside down; 3) finally, I brush them. The whole procedure takes me approx. 15 minutes, using the maximal power (level 3) and heat (again 3) of the hair dryer.<br /><br />My husband has way shorted and fewer hair than I do, straight and thin. He uses my same shampoo and conditioner, but won't do anything more than that. He wouldn't need to use a hair dryer, but love the feeling. It takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry.<br /><br />My dog is a Scottish Terrier - so she's small but has longish and super thick fur. We wash her in the bathtub with natural Castille soap. To dry her fur, we first wrap her in a towel, and remove most of the water, then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat (level 2) and cold air to avoid burning her skin. When she starts being somewhat dryer, we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair (e.g. armpits). It takes us approx. 1 hour.<br /><br />To sum up, this hair dryer is durable and high quality - a great bang for the buck!",7/18/2015,1,1

I don't see why this dryer would be any worse than others.<br /><br />It IS stronger than my old dryer but I had to try them both back to back to convince myself, the difference is not dramatic. I like having two speeds and three temps that operate independently, so you can have high heat and low fan if you want, or vice versa. I've never had a cool temp before so I tried it, who knows, maybe that is why my hair feels especially nice.<br /><br />It's definitely heavier than the average cheap blow dryer but it did seem that my hair dried quicker so I think it's an OK trade-off. Also my old dryer's motor sounds pretty cheap and sick after the hum of this one, but I don't find much difference in loudness or tone.<br /><br />I like the rocker controls. The whole reason I bought a new dryer is that my really old dryer died, I had a spare hanging around the house that I started to use, but it has slider controls and I found it impossible to change settings without stopping and looking and even then it was hard to move the sliders. With this new dryer I can easily change a setting and I find it easy to keep my fingers slightly to the side of the controls to avoid accidentally making changes.",9/21/2014,1,1

Being Dominican, I remember going to the salon every Saturday morning since I was 10 with my mother so that we could pay 20-30 dollars for our lady to blow dry my hair.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years (I'm 30 now): I work full time, am married, AND went back to school. So, I don't have time to go to the salon and sit there for hours until my hair gets blown out.<br /><br />Thankfully, with my hair, all I have to do are rollers and sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and boom...no salon, nice waves, better than blown out! Much cheaper than going to the salon, btw.<br /><br />I looove that the dryer has a timer, which means I don't have to watch the clock constantly. The dryer gets VERY hot, almost too hot (I used the highest setting), but that means I spent less time under the dryer. It's not very loud at all, which I also like. Also, in order to adjust height in most dryers, one needs to turn some sort of knob, right? Not with this one! I just push it down as low as I need or pull it up as high as I need, and I'm done.

I'm looking to buy my own for convenience. My mother originally bought this dryer because it was used in a lot of Dominican salons and the fact that she's had it over 10 years I think speaks for itself. We didn't buy it on Amazon but, at a local beauty supply for about $60 then.  I wanted to leave a review because I felt that a lot of reviews I've seen for different dryers were left by people with hair types that could be dried well even without a hair dryer. Not so for me.<br /><br />My hair:<br />- Thick<br />- Coarse<br />- Long (past the middle of my back)<br />- Dominican (if that helps)<br />- Cannot air dry it (it would dry very puffy and frizzy if so)<br />- Has been relaxed (I relax it 2-4 times a year)<br />- Retains water (humid weather wreaks havoc)<br /><br />What seems to be most people's hair types in hair dryer reviews overall (not just this one):<br />- Able to dry with minimal effort (no brushing or able to point the dryer generally and have their hair still dry straight)<br />- Hair that can dry in 5-20 minutes with minimal effort<br />- Thick (though I think some people are confused as to their actual hair type)<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this hair dryer is only 1300 watts. After reading many dryer reviews, I thought I'd need something that was 2000 watts. Now, I'm rethinking that because this still does a good job at 1300. I think some people who leave dryer reviews don't know their actual hair type and/or how to properly blow dry their hair for a smooth, lasting, straight finish. Sometimes it's not the dryer's fault but, HOW people attempt to dry their hair. My mother does hair very well (if you've ever gone to a Dominican salon, you know that Dominican salons tend to do hair well). Some people at other salons tend to dry all hair types as if they are the same and dry the same and that isn't the case, leaving me (or others Iknow with similar hair) with terrible results. These have been my experiences and obviously don't apply to everyone. I don't like going to salons and haven't gone in years. Using this dryer, I have always received compliments on how nice and straight my hair looks.<br /><br />When I first tried to do my own hair (without really knowing how to) using someone's John Frieda 1875 watt hair dryer. I did a horrible job that took me a very long time and ended with puffy hair, not smooth at all but at least dry. If you don't use a blow dryer on a hot enough setting, it will not dry well, it only gets the water out of your hair is all. My mother, using the same dryer, did a much better job similar to the results with this dryer.  You have to use a brush of some type (round or straight) to pull and straighten the hair for a smooth finish.  You should also dry only small sections at a time for better results and always point the dryer down and in the direction of the hair shaft using the concentrator nozzle. I use a thermal protector as well as other products for shine so, I can't comment on the dryer's efficacy on those things.<br /><br />PROS about this dryer:<br />- Takes my hair only about 40 minutes to fully dry (after just squeezing out excess water with a towel, parting, clipping and drying small sections at a time. Compare this to salons where I have to sit under a hooded dryer for well over an hour and have them still blow dry my hair straight after, which takes another 20 minutes or so for a total of almost two hours.)<br />- Dries smoothly and straightens well (no need to use a flat iron after)<br />- Gets very hot<br />- Strong air flow<br />- Good weight (not too heavy)<br />- Buttons are well placed (don't accidentally press anything)<br />- Long cord length (Haven't measured it exactly but, it is at least 6 feet, probably more and has never been an issue)<br />- Removable filter (can easily clean for a longer life)<br />- Durable (has been owned for at least 10years and still works well, using it several times a week on 2-3 people with similar hair types to my own)<br />- Comes with a concentrator nozzle (Stays put and after years of accidental drops has never broken)<br />- Could go for up to a week without having to redo hair<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Brand name rubbed off after many years (I don't care but, may be a con for some)<br />- Gets very hot (have to protect my ears sometimes and cannot leave it close to my scalp for long. Good that it gets that hot but, you have to be careful so it's a pro and con)<br />- Loud (I think most dryers are. In terms of hearing conservation, I would recommend using ear plugs with dryers since they are so close to your head/ears and are very loud for a long period of time. This could eventually result in some amount of noise-induced hearing loss. Not specifically with just this dryer but, any dryer.)<br />- Only has a hot and cool setting (each with different strengths. The cool setting isn't that cool, it is warm although I've only used it after using hot for over 30 minutes. This is only a con if you're looking for a dryer with a cool shot.)<br />- Somewhat expensive (there are many dryers available for half this price so it is an investment)<br />- Not compact (If you're looking for something like that. I have had bad experiences with hotel dryers that leave my hair a big puffy mess so I will still pack and use this, even though it is a full size hair dryer. It's that good.)<br /><br />I would recommend this product but, I am not personally buying it for myself because it is over my budget. I am looking for a dryer that is less than $40-50 and available through prime. This dryer is not available with prime shipping and the beauty supply store has jacked up the price over the years. If you can afford to spend that amount on a dryer, it is a good investment. I'd prefer not to if I can find something that works as well as this one for less money. If I do find something like that, I will definitely share that (I'm researching and will try) but, at least I have this dryer as a backup if anything.",3/29/2013,1,1

She liked that I was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs. I love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing.

It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.<br /><br />My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others.

It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer.

I was super disappointed given my glowing review below. I have not even contacted Amazon or the manufacturer since it's past the 30 days. The wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit, I smelled smoke. At first thought it was my hair. But, the thing died shortly after. I have another blow dryer. Not sure if I received a lemon or if this is Andis quality. My past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7-10 years. 4 months was a HUGE let down  PREVIOUS REVIEW BELOW:  Definite space saver. Quiet. Does the job. I feel the low setting is definitely very low, much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore. However, I like the higher setting. It's nice to wash, blowdry and head out. Makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized. This blow dryer comes with two long screws. You have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back. I then marked the walls where the two holes are. The plastic anchors I did not use, because the frame/holder is super light weight. So is the dryer. It's nice. In addition, the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom. Personally, I wish I could change the color to clear or blue. The photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side. There are two other sm/med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side. I prefer the right side; however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom. It's a great product. They thought of almost everything on this dryer. The only two things I would change is to have even a more minimized holder (semi-translucent), optional colored dryers, retractable cord, small dryer, more powerful, cool air option dryer (i.e. fan with a hold button ;-), no cord but a chargeable blow dryer.

Nice!,"This is the best hair dryer I've ever had:<br /><br />The size is not too large or too long--the picture makes it look larger than it actually is. It is light-weight. The handle provides a perfect grip. The motor cools down very quickly and the casing does not retain heat.<br /><br />The buttons are all you could possibly ask for--and they are very conveniently located right on the handle where your fingers wrap around it. You don't have to shift your grip or stop what you are doing to change a heat setting or blow setting. Don't think that your fingers could accidently trip a botton: They are raised buttons and have a definite angle and curve and your fingers have to purposefully push them one way or the other to make changes. The cold buttom works very quickly, too.<br /><br />There is a loop for hanging, a safety plug and a long cord.<br /><br />It has the normal attachments, PLUS a pretty nifty one that is suited for nice, long, fine hair. It will be able to help lift a large section of hair and shoot many channels of air into the section.<br /><br />Last, but not least, it is a beautiful thing to look at.

One reason is tactile; it has a nice almost-soft finish that's comfortable to touch or hold.  Ergonomically, it simply feels right in my hand.  It's very well balanced.  The cool air option works great; far cooler air (esp for a sustained time) than any other dryer I've owned.  The air opening is a little bit smaller than average, so it provided well directed air.  (There is also a good diffuser included if you need to diffuse rather than direct.)  Provides a good and shiny and smooth blow out.  Quickly.  Even on cool air!

Well Worth the Money!!!,"I have long hair, that is about half way down my back.  I've never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry.  Lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if I air dry it, so it doesn't look as nice, and I've started blowing it dry most times I wash it.  Previously, I've only purchased a couple of hair dryers, and I don't think I spent much money on them.  I have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me, I did a little research before buying a new one.  I never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer.  I mean, aren't they all the same?  I soon learned that the answer is NO.<br /><br />This is still a fairly new product, so there were not a lot of reviews to go by.  I did research on what to look for in a hair dryer.  It was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer.  Tourmaline? Ceramic? Well, ok, but what about nanoe?  It seems that Panasonic is the only one using this technology right now.  Infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers?  I was definitely skeptical when I read that.<br /><br />I knew that I definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat, and the Panasonic EH-NA65-K has that.  I was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments.  The nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when I was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer.  The Panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for.  They are nice attachments!<br /><br />As I said before, there were only a few reviews out there, but what was there was nothing but great reviews.  What the heck, I decided to give it a try and I must say that I'm very pleased.  This hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one.  I also really noticed how much I am used to the quietness of this the last time I got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair.  It was way louder.  This also dries my hair much quicker, which is really nice.  With the amount of hair I have, it takes a while to dry.  Most of the time I am using the quick dry nozzle.  I also found that I didn't need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer.  I just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when I'm done.  As for the flyaways, it didn't completely solve that problem, but it does seem to make that better too.<br /><br />After using this hair dryer the first time, I thought my hair looked a little darker than normal, and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since I know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair.  The next day, one of my coworkers asked me if I did something different to my hair.  I asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal.  I have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before.  I couldn't believe it!  I didn't tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer.  That told me that what I noticed must have been true.<br /><br />To summarize, I am very happy with my new hair dryer.  It hurt to spend this much money at first, but now I think it was well worth the cost.  Now I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer.  This hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one, due to the nanoe port on the top.  Between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer, I don't really want to take it with me when I travel.  I travel for business about once a month a really miss this hair dryer when I'm gone.<br /><br />Panasonic, please make a Travel Nanoe Hair Dryer!",9/19/2014,1,1

A beautician friend of mine recommended switching to a ceramic iononic conditioning hair dryer and recommended the brand Hot Tools. I had purchased a ridiculously over priced hot tools hair dryer and I figured you have to pay more for results. I no longer had dry frizzy hair after blow drying, it was silky, soft and smooth just like after the salon and I was overjoyed. Several weeks ago my hot tools hair drier broke. I couldn't afford to replace it so I looked for a cheaper alternative. I found this dryer for more than 50 dollars cheaper than the one I was trying to replace and it had very similar specifications, so I took a chance and I've never been happier. It does such a better job than the over priced professional hair dryer. My hair dries in nearly half the time. It's never been smoother or softer.<br /><br />The drier is much lighter than my old one and comfortably fits in my hand due to its ergonomic shape. It isn't very loud like most driers, instead of a high pitched whiny sound it's nice low whooshy sound. I always compared hair driers to sounding like a power drill... well this one doesn't sound like a power drill, it sounds like a device that blows air, like it should. The included attachments (concentrator and diffuser) are an added bonus. I've used the concentrator with great success and I haven't used the diffuser yet (since I recently cut my hair very short and only use a diffuser for my natural waves when my hair is long).<br /><br />For the price the blow dryer definitely exceeds expectations.

I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.

Since then I've tried resetting the switch on the plug itself as well as tried various outlets around the house. Something seems to have shorted out in it. I figured a hair dryer was a hair dryer and the $20 one should work just as well, but after this experience and after using better ones that my friends have had serve them well for several years and dry my hair more quickly, I think I'll pony up the extra $20 and save myself the headache of having to buy another hair dryer in the near future.

It feels soft to the touch rather than the slick plastic of the older models. But after just a couple of weeks of use, the coating started bubbling and peeling off in the area where I hold the hair dryer. I've only had it for a month and a half, and the outer coating looks positively pathetic already. I also don't like the settings on this model--there are only two speed settings, with the lower one being barely on. The high setting is okay, but it does make me feel like I'm in a wind tunnel at times.  This hair dryer has some pros: It gets quite hot, and it's fairly lightweight.

I always thought air drying was best for the health of my hair but lately my hair has gotten so gross and messy and frizzy that I almost considered giving myself a hair cut and just chopping off everything off a few times. I did start using a cleanser once a week and that helped somewhat but my hair was still just horrible. So instead of doing something drastic I decided to give blow drying a chance. I bought the Babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so I've only ever used the two together. Before I get into the results, my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1. The black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2. It's a lot lighter than I expected. Everybody complained about how heavy it was. Again, I've never owned a hair dryer so maybe they're normally a lot lighter then this one. But from me, no complaints!<br /><br />And to the results... My hair is absolutely amazing now. Sometimes I'll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and I'm just so happy. It's like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that. It takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it. I put in some before products, lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls! And the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days. Sometimes I'll rewet my hair and diffuse it for about 5 minutes to add more curl to it but then I'm good to go!<br /><br />I've never used the blow dryer to straighten my hair yet but if and when I do I'll review that. But for now I'm loving my curls!!",9/27/2014,1,1

From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too.",3/27/2008,1,1

My daughter isn't a huge fan of getting her hair dryed, and happily, this dryer reduces the torture time exponentially. I want to say the difference is in the diffuser, but there's more going on here. It isn't quite &#34;magical&#34;, but it's close.<br /><br />The &#34;magical&#34; part is probably with my wife's naturally curly hair. During the winter months, there's been some investment in products that control frizz, and I've been able to casually tell a difference between products. With this hair dryer, though, you'd swear some really expensive salon-grade stuff was used. The results are pretty surprising, and seem to last. I'd almost go as far as saying that this could save money, by reducing (or eliminating) the need for control products.<br /><br />At first, I was positive there was no way this hair dryer would be worth the money, but seeing how well it works with everyone in the family, I'd totally recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or who can't tolerate much time under the dryer.",11/25/2014,1,1

Shortly thereafter I received an email from them asking me to return the broken one and they would send a replacement.  They sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days I had a new dryer that I have been using since with no problems.  Granted it has only been a month but I was very impressed with Remington.  I just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer (lol)... it really did blow flames.  Obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that I had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously I only give it 1.  I really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic.  Plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out.<br /><br />PREVIOUS REVIEW:  Bought this dryer 4 months ago even though I read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name. i only use a hair dryer at most 2x/wk. Last night I was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it!!! Thank God my hair was wet and didn't have any flammable product in it. I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon. I have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary.<br /><br />1/18/13 - Almost 1 year later... and still working perfectly.  In fact, I bought another dryer in the interim, waiting for the new Remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one.  I used both multiple times, trading off one for the other. I found that I prefer the Remington over the other more expensive name brand dryer. The Remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen (is that possible?).

Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn't had that problem with this dyer, and to me that's saying A LOT.<br /><br />John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It's well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it's designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here's my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...<br />The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.<br /><br />She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.<br />The only really `con' with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it's not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use).

There are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from, and I mostly liked this one while it worked.  BRIGHT night light (can be good or bad.. I liked it), nice physical design, and decent power.  I thought the air volume still did not compete with most $15 standard dryers, but if you are not looking for big air volume, it is fine. My wife misses a cold button.  So in all, a mediocre hair dryer but with great wall mount convenience and bright night light.  Now with the issues... Bought 18 months ago, worked fine except overheated very easily. If used on HIGH, it would run as long as you want till you shut it off, then the internal temperature would apparently overheat with no more airflow, and would refuse to turn back on for 5 minutes or so.  Annoying, but I got used to it by going to medium heat for about 10 seconds before shutting it off every time.  That seemed to cool it down just enough not to trigger the temperature limiter in case I needed to turn it back on right away.  I probably would have pitched it, but I liked the wall mount convenience and put 4 holes in my wall to mount it.  Well, here we are 18 months of life, and now it is completely dead. Night light on but the hair dryer is not home. I am electrically capable and could probably open up and fix this thing, but it is not worth the safety concern.  If you want to pay a premium for wall mount, just know you might only get a year or two out of it.. others seems to have similar experiences.  Sad that the $10 hand held models seem to last much longer.  Anyway, to cover up the holes in the walls, I am trying one of the other few wall mount options out there by another manufacturer. If this one dies, I am giving up on wall mount.  Good luck... hair dryers should not take this much thought.",7/18/2011,1,1

I won't buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  The filter is easy to remove and clean It also isn't too heavy.  The color is cute, although I don't know if most men would like it.<br /><br />On using it, it has good power, and it's not too noisy.  It also doesn't get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that's not bad.  If you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer, this is totally doable.  And it's cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  The cord is a good length.<br /><br />The retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn't come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  It's a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.<br /><br />All that said, I have two issues with this product.  The first is minor... there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up!  I keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet, and it's an annoyance that I can't hang this there.  And because the cord is retractable, you can't really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.<br /><br />The second issue is more significant.  I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  It gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it.  I can't say whether this is a problem will this model, or just for some reason the one that I was sent.  But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.<br /><br />This dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of ionic, tourmaline etc., I don't see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I'd rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.

My hair is thick, with a wave, and it absolutely mushrooms after blowdrying or in high humidity. It takes forever to dry my hair, so naturally your weary arms tick up the heat factor to get it DRY already, and that in turn ups the frizz factor.    I must say, I was impressed. The dryer features several heat and style settings, so to give an honest portrayal of the results, I kept the heat on the equivalent settings as my usual blow dryer. Then, after a while when my arms would usually get tired, I increased the volume setting.    Unfortunately, with this blow dryer, I wasn't faking the exhaustion in my arms. This isn't the heaviest blow dryer I've ever used, but it's up there! If there was such a thing as getting muscled from using blow dryers, I'd be Ahnold already. I wasn't faking it when I reached the point in the blow drying when my arms were saying, Enough already!    The dryer is more than enough power to accomplish the job. What was interesting was after my hair was dry, it really WAS less frizzy than the same routine done with my usual blower dryer.    The second time I tried it, it was raining out and about a billion percent humidity, the perfect laboratory for determining if all the tourmaline/titanium/ceramic add-ons actually worked to keep hair smooth.    It kind of did. What I can say was my hair frizzed, but it frizzed LESS, and it was much shinier than I've ever seen my hair in humid weather. I guess that's an endorsement, but not enough of one where one might forgo a flat iron to flatten out the kinks.     The dryer comes with a diffuser, which I've always found to be WAY too much work and time (if your arms hurt with regular blow drying, you'll be crippled when you're done using a diffuser on thick hair!)    If you're in the market for a blow dryer, and you have a problem with the frizzes, you might want to give the Remington serious consideration.

I was very happy with the dryer, as it was powerful and offered a reasonable selection of temperatures.  I exercised proper care for the dryer and never abused it.  However, Friday morning I turned the dryer on, and since it is getting cold, I decided to use high heat instead of medium heat like I almost always choose.  After just a few moments there came a hot, nasty smelling smoke jetting out from behind the power switch.  I unplugged the dryer and have not plugged it back in since.<br /><br />I went to Target to find a replacement, and was disappointed.  None of them performed as well as this one.  But I'm afraid to buy another.  What has the world come to when you can't even buy a decent hair dryer for less than $75 unless you're willing to accept this kind of crappy workmanship?  I guess the solution is to buy them in quantity and treat them as disposable.<br /><br />If it didn't perform so well (when it wasn't producing smoke and fire) then I'd give it the minimum score... but since it really does work nice, I'll give it two stars.  Buy more than one, and don't let them run unattended.",10/26/2010,1,1

The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style. You have to hold it just right so you don't turn it off or change the heat setting.<br /><br />THEN IT DIED - - -  DEAD, DEAD, DEAD!<br /><br />I was amazed that this hair dryer could sell for $11, it even comes with a diffuser and other accessories. I only used the dryer every other day for 6 weeks (so about 21 times) for about 5 - 10 minutes (max) each time...  I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????  I am not that stupid, I will cut my losses at $11.<br /><br />I know that so many other people have had the same problem with the short lifespan of this dryer -  i wish i had taken the time to read all the reviews.<br /><br />Conair & Amazon should stop selling these items, they know they are junk - that's why they offer them so cheap & that people are going to buy them because they are so cheap.

I don't think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many 'Top Ten Hair Dryer' lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what 'technologies' exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho' people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn't happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn't 'lock' but I don't care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can't believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference. I actually look forward to doing my hair now! My recommendation is, do your research, but if you have hair similar to mine, give this fantastic dryer a try - I don't think you'll be disappointed!frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy.

The problem is that they don't last. The night light in the white one went out on the second day. The night light in the black one went out on the third day. After I drilled the holes to mount them, I didn't really want to bother with the hassle to return them since the hair dryers both work fine.  I'm pretty sure I saw a cheaper version of these without the night light, and that's what I'd recommend. I'm used to a bit more wind from my regular dryer (at three times the size) but these dryers still complete the job in about the same amount of time.  The ones I received DO have the coiled cord, exactly like the picture (some say they received straight cords) and it turns off automatically when you return the dryer to the holder.  My only complaints are the night lights going out (of course) and the fact that you can't remove the dryer from the holder to pack in a suitcase, which is a shame because they are very small and would be great for travel if you could.  All in all I'm happy with the purchase.",10/22/2011,1,1

Well, most importantly, it's 1875 watts dries your hair very quickly. I have shoulder length, straight, fine but fairly thick hair and this drier has it dry within 5 minutes. I was a little skeptical about the ion thing at first, but I have to admit that my hair does feel a little smoother and softer after using this dryer. What I like most about the dryer is that it has two rocker switches with lots of setting possibilities. One controls the high/low/off settings and the other controls the hot/warm/cold. It's nice that you can do them in any combination which makes for a lot of choices. I usually am in a hurry and use the hot and high settings. (Some day I'll start getting up earlier or start getting ready before the last minute, but until then, I need a dryer like this!) It also has a cool button so when you're styling your hair and have a section of hair wrapped around your brush to make it flip up or under you can hit it with the hot air first, and then the cool to set it before unwrapping it. This works so well and so quickly, that it's one of the first hair dryers that I can get away with not using a curling iron and still have my hair styled the way I like it.<br /><br />This dryer is very spacey looking in a silver gray color with a purple/blue racing stripe down the side. The cord is gray. I guess what my hair dryer looks like isn't that big of a deal but why settle for a drab looking one when you can have one with a little pizzaz? It comes with a diffuser and two other attachments for directing the air flow. The size of this dryer is pretty substantial, but it isn't too heavy, it's just a nice weight. I would say it's about average as far as noise goes. I've actually had travel sized hair dryers that were noisier than this one. All in all it's an excellent dryer that does exactly what I want it to do which is to dry my hair quickly and leave it looking soft and full.",7/30/2011,1,1

I don't know but I am really glad to have it.  Purchased at Folica when they had a $40 off special.<br /><br />I have thick medium length wavy fine hair.  Wash it 5-6 days a week at the gym.  Had been using their Hot Tools dryers-- two at a time, one in each hand--quite a spectacle -- and then using a flat iron.  I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.<br /><br />Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .<br /><br />Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.<br />I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.<br /><br />I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.  But I am very happy with the Sedu.",3/31/2012,1,1

I mean huge.  Now maybe it's because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less.  When it is open, it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned.  When it is closed (folded, for &#34;travel&#34; -- heh, like this would handily fit in a suitcase) this thing is almost as big as my dopp (shaving bag).  Fortunately we travel more by ground so we don't worry much about suitcase space.<br /><br />And, as others have mentioned, the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries.  We can live with that.  Even once the cord is stored, the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out.  It wasn't a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too.<br /><br />On the plus side it does dry hair quickly.  FYI, all the girls in our family have long thick hair.<br /><br />A very important feature this dryer has -- and a major reason I chose it -- is that it does have a &#34;medium&#34; heat setting.  (Most just have high and low, with low being very low.)  The reason &#34;medium&#34; is important, especially on a high wattage unit, is that &#34;high&#34; can blow circuit breakers.  If you don't whether you have 20amp service on an outlet, you may really want the medium setting.  (Ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife's hair is wet?)  The &#34;medium&#34; setting dries hair just fine.  The high setting dries hair scary fast, but I'm not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run, but it is nice to have when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />A word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel:  always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need.  I don't know if it tells you that in the manual but it's always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot.  From staring at this unit, it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but I wouldn't rely on that.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right.",12/22/2012,1,1

Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they鈥檙e both preferable IMO.<br /><br />Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that鈥檚 so that there aren鈥檛 large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair鈥檚 clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn鈥檛 give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for 鈥減ixiecurling.鈥?For those who don鈥檛 know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by 鈥減ixiecurl鈥?on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer鈥檚 diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn鈥檛 on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn鈥檛 being pushed away by airflow when you鈥檙e positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyOypbTHI0&#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it鈥檚 a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that鈥檚 no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button. I don鈥檛 use high speed because it disorganizes my curls. I鈥檓 also unlikely to use hot, but it鈥檚 nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time. The Conair has Hi, Off, and Lo, along with a cool shot button, so airspeed and heat, or lack thereof, are connected to each other, and I score another one for the Curlipops.<br /><br />Whine: the Conair has it in spades, and the Curlipops has very little. So I give this one to the Curlipops too.<br /><br />Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that鈥檚 really the shipping weight. It鈥檚 a little more than I鈥檇 like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don鈥檛 need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it鈥檚 still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother鈥檚 non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created. So score one for both pancake dryers. However, neither one has dual voltage, and the Curlipops鈥檚 instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter, so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of North America.Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews. For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair. Now I'm going to buy one for my daughter-in-law!",4/5/2012,1,1

This hair dryer is excellent because it is lightweight and dries my hair very quickly with much less frizz than ordinary hair dryers. I also purchased the T3 Tourmaline Diffuser and love it because I have naturally wavy hair and it leaves my hair with nice waves, much less frizz and it does not feel crunchy and dry at the ends - just nice soft waves.

I needed to purchase a new one quickly, saw this one in a local store, and picked it up.<br /><br />This dryer has several very nice features.  First, it has three HEAT settings (hot, warm, cool) PLUS two STRENGTH settings (low and high).  In addition, you have the option of boost the air flow with the turbo button and also using the cool shot button to set your style.  I have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat-high power setting, then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling.  Using this method, I am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer.  This dryer's nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer, meaning that I bumped my head the first few times I used it, but I quickly got used to this.  For a larger dryer, I find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well.<br /><br />Another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen; although I was attracted to this concept, I am unable to get the back off!  Perhaps we just have a dud, but it simply does not move.  Also, I should mention that the attachment is HUGE.  I hadn't really planned on using it anyway, but when I did try to snap it on to the dryer, I could not get it on easily.<br /><br />Overall, I have have been quite happy with this hair dryer--I just wish the back would come off.  My final rating is 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Edited 4/1/13:  Good news--I was able to get the back off this morning!  It seems like it just suddenly came unstuck when I tried it again (after many tries).

She uses a hair drier frequently and have seen her with frizzy hair from it at times. I figured this would be a perfect test.<br /><br />The dryer has a balanced feel to it and isn't too heavy. The body is made of plastic that feels solid. If you squeeze it will creak and crack but it still feels solid. The intake and output screens are metal and should hold up well. It has a very nice cable stress relief on the dryer side that looks like it will help with and last through all the waving around that is sure to come. The plug side has a nice and compact GFI built into it so you are less likely to die from using it. Size wise I think this is a stay at home dryer. I would look for something a bit more compact for travel if you need one.<br /><br />The side of the handle contains two switches. One for temperature (cool, warm, and hot) one for speed (off, low, and high). There is a momentary switch on the handle in the trigger position for the cool shot function.<br /><br />After turning her loose with this for a few weeks my wife says her hair definitely is less frizzy and feels softer after using this dryer versus her other dryer. I can confirm this as well, it feels softer to me and I notice it is less frizzy.<br /><br />I'm sold on it after seeing what it does and as with anything your mileage may vary but it works well for my wife and she wouldn't hesitate to recommend this dryer to her friends.",9/13/2011,1,1

I was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews, but when it was discounted on a Friday Sale, I figured I'd give it a shot. SO glad I did!<br /><br />To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.<br /><br />I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).<br /><br />The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.<br /><br />Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.<br /><br />The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.<br /><br />In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.<br /><br />Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",4/15/2007,1,1

The features I like about the Andis hair dryers I've used were that they were not too large or heavy, they had medium heat to medium-high heat, they didn't blow too hard, and they were relatively quite.  I've used some hair dryers that almost gave me wrist strain trying to hold them, and some that caused your ears to ring once your hair was dry.  The Andis' hangup models seem to find a good compromise between function and low noise levels. I've put these in all our bathrooms at home, since they can be used without disturbing others in the house even if they are sleeping.  Some different models of Andis dryers I've owned before would stop working after about a year due to a diode on the on/off switch overheating and failing, but this model doesn't seem to have that issue.  Other nice features that this 30975/HD-10L has are that there is no GFI transformer plug at the end of the cord...It's built into the base housing of the dryer.  Also, this unit comes with a cord hang-up bracket which can be placed on either side of the base. Like other hair dryers the on/off switch will reset to the off position when it's placed back into the base wall holder. Taking the dryer out of the base again will resume the flow of warm air. Some reviewers have complained of the brightness of the built-in nightlight. It's not annoying to me and it can be use it as the only nightlight in the bathroom. If I could ask for only one additional feature, it would be a way to change the color of the LED light.  There are many LED nightlights on the market that let you select what color you'd like the light to have, and lock it to that color.  This would be a nice feature to have on this unit, and might please those that think the light is too bright.  Last, this unit has a metal wall bracket and paper template, so it's actually very easy to install. The plastic base then screws to the metal plate, once mounted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base. Any excess cord can be hidden inside the base, so between not having an unsightly GFI box on the plug end and the fact that you can shorten the cord to just a few inches, if needed, makes for a very clean installation. No cords unsightly tangled cords hanging around your bath to get caught on other stuff.  And not having the GFI plug allows other appliances like cordless tooth brushes, shavers, or rollers to be used on the same wall outlet without the adjacent plug(s) being blocked.ted, with two small screws hidden by the hair dryer when it's in the base.

One of the things that I have come to really appreciate about this dryer is that the low fan setting truly is low. So many other dryers give you high and higher as choices. I don't want to achieve the head out the car window look, I want just enough airflow to get the job done. Of course, there is a high setting if you do want more. The other noteworthy thing is that cleaning lint out of the dryer is so easy! The lint screen removes very easily and can be cleaned in seconds and replaced.

One was a Conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer. The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.<br /><br />All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.<br /><br />I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.<br /><br />I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.<br /><br />Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well.

I just got a MC11H6033 1.1 cu.ft Counter Top Convection Microwave w/SLIM FRY as a gift. I contacted the chat support as I had a few questions, all of which were answered with, No, but only after I was basically told Yes to all three questions and then dared to question the Yes.<br /><br />I asked if there was a timer function, told yes, then told no after I asked the rep to tell me where it was located, and how to set and use it. Who makes a microwave in 2014 that doesn't have a timer?<br /><br />I asked if there was a more extensive food prep guide/recipe book available to use with the unit because the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide literally only lists 1 food item per function. There's 1000s of foods that could be made using things like the Slim Fry function, but no way to know which of the 1-9 settings to use because there's only 9 food items listed in the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide under the Slim Fry entry. There is apparently no app with this information available either. Neither is there a formula for figuring out how to Slim Fry additional foods other than those listed in the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide. This problem persists throughout the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide in that every function other than straight microwave or straight convection cooking does not give enough information to be able to choose the correct function and setting for foods other than those listed. I only found this information out after asking which setting to use to cook Pre-breaded Fried Okra. I was answered, You can use the slim fry option 2 for Pre-breaded frozen Fried Okra. I asked, How and where did you find that information? He replied, I have gathered the information from our internal database. I stated, I don't exactly have access to your internal database, now do I? So, no additional cooking info publicly available. I guess if I want to try to Slim Fry frozen cheese sticks, I'll need to contact Customer Service and ask which setting to use because apparently, in the world of frozen food, Pre-breaded frozen Fried Okra is equal to that of Frozen Prawns [shrimp], Breaded. That's the example food for Slim Fry option 2 as per the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide.<br /><br />I asked if there were sheet pans, cookware, or bakeware available to be purchased from Samsung, or elsewhere, that were known to fit in the unit; specifically sheet pans. Standard size 1/4 (quarter) sheet pans won't fit because the 9.5 x 13 size is determined by the usable flat surface area and not the outside of the pan itself. No standard 9.5 x 13 sheet pan is 9.5 x 13 on the outside dimensions that I am aware of. SO, where would I get pans that fit? Apparently Customer Service, nor Parts, has a clue. Who makes the inside of an appliance, capable of being a convection oven, too small for standard size bakeware? Toaster ovens don't count - but they do at least have after-market sheet pans available out there that fit in them. If I'd wanted to make cookies on pans that small, I'd have expressed interest in a convection toaster oven to make 6 cookies at a time, not a convection microwave oven. It should also be noted the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide makes a big deal out of you Choosing the Proper Cookware. This is covered from pg 22 to pg 25.<br /><br />I was told by Customer Service, initially, that what I was looking for was available, and to contact Parts about those last two questions. I did. I checked online and I called. The girl who answered actually hung up on me after I insisted that Customer Service had referred me and that indeed those parts should be available. After she ended our conversation abruptly, I brought the absence of those parts to the attention of the Customer Service rep I was chatting with.<br /><br />Other than the above, the straight microwave function and straight convection function work well. The drop-down oven style door is a really nice feature. The blue display lighting is pretty.<br /><br />How does a company make a product without giving the consumer, or providing to the consumer at an additional charge, adequate instruction or equipment to use their product? I just don't understand how someone puts out a product with 1000 uses and only reveals 20 of them. Obviously people like me don't test them out or question the developers or designers or engineers before putting a product on the market without adequate instruction or equipment to use their product.<br /><br />Obviously, my logic is lost on Samsung - or it's too complex a logic for someone who works there to have figured out. In any case, with a hefty $249 on sale to $399 full retail price tag; the MC11H6033 1.1 cu.ft Counter Top Convection Microwave with SLIM FRY is definitely not worth the money since you can't use it to it's full potential.<br /><br />Review Update:<br />So, as of Christmas Day, I still hadn't found a commercially available sheet pan that actually fit inside the unit. My mother gave me an old broiler pan that she had for a long gone oversized convection toaster oven.<br /><br />I was using just the convection oven feature on the unit for the first time (I'd only used the Slim Fry feature to that point) to cook a dish for Christmas dinner; all of a sudden it just stopped working. The unit head cut off and there was no display visible. I thought maybe I'd tripped the breaker. I unplugged the unit and checked; I had not tripped the breaker, but I turned it off and back on just to be sure. I plug the unit back in and nothing. I've been found something else to plug into that outlet so that I can make sure the outlet was in fact functioning correctly. It was. I then pulled out the owners manual and proceeded to the troubleshooting section. It recommended unplugging the unit for three seconds and plugging it back in. I unplugged it, and left it unplugged for a solid five minutes. I plugged it back in and still nothing.<br /><br />For a unit this expensive to conk out while using one of the features for the first time, definitely says nothing good about the unit. For the unit to conk out while making Christmas dinner; that was just a headache I didn't need that day. I would dub this a completely unreliable unit.<br /><br />I regret that I never did have the chance to try french fries using the Slim Fry option.",12/4/2014,-1,1

When you cook at 50% power, it cooks at 50% power rather than cycling on and off at 100% power, for 50% of the time.  This makes a massive difference on how things cook.  We previously had a GH5184XPS with Accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking.  It was starting to not look so nice from normal use, so I decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one.      After the new microwave was installed, I tried a cup of water in it.  When I started it, it sounded like an arc welder, and when I looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is, it looked like an arc torch flame.  I quickly turned it off so it wouldn't burn the place down.  They took it back and gave me another.  The very night we got it, we were making popcorn in the special Microwave Popcorn bowl, which we had used for years with our other microwaves.  Within a minute, we got an F7 - Call For Service code.  They offered to exchange it for a new one, but didn't have another, but told me they could sell me the new 5184, and updated model of our old one.  I noticed that the new one had a broiler, slightly different menus, $50 cheaper, and we had good luck with our previous 5184.  However, after it was installed, the cook said, this doesn't cook right.  I checked it out.  The updated 5184 no longer has Accuwave.  That isn't how it was represented, so I gave them their $50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory.  That went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time, the magnetron noise would stop, the fan speed up, the light got brighter, and the food stopped cooking.  Since the chicken was still pink, I added 2 minutes at full power, and immediately received an F7 code.  The problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation.  You don't get the F7 until you try to start it again,and the magnetron doesn't start.  We couldn't trust it with chicken.  We avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the F7 codes.  As time progressed, we could do less and less.  Now, you can't even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal.      That was enough for me.  There is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory, so there is no point in getting another new one.  Thus, I decided I would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that WILL work.  The dealer-recommended warranty repair source wouldn't take the job when he learned which model it was.  Whirlpool got another company to come the following morning.  They put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it, and could find nothing wrong.  They said their manual doesn't even list an F7 code.  There is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water.  I went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about F7 for this microwave model, with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot.  Then I put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an F7.  Included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes, but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board.  The on-site techs did not follow the checklist, and called the factory.  The factory told them they will send them a switch to try.  (I was hoping it would be the thermal switch, but the techs indicated it was not.)  The on-site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid-cycle.  The factory came back with, as it gets hotter, the switch contacts may be increasing resistance, causing the problem.  I could repeat the F7 at will.  They did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the F7 error.  Next Wednesday, the switch is scheduled to be delivered, and the techs will be returning to put it in.  The service company also had little confidence in the factory's recommendation, but they have to do what the factory says.  Perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn't take the job for this model.      I've been through 3 of this model, and 4 installs, since April 5 2011, and I don't have a good microwave yet.  They've eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth.  Now it's my turn.  I will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised, on real food, or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value, that works as advertised, for free, and with a new warranty.",6/22/2011,-1,1

I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath.",7/3/2013,-1,1

If you are cooking in something too large to make the rotation, the turntable function can be damaged. I'm not used to having to push a cook time button before selecting the time. I'll get used to that, though. It gives three long beeps when the time is up, which is kind of annoying to me for some reason. Even when you open the door, the beeps continue. I haven't used it much yet. I tried the popcorn feature, and it needed at least another minute of cooking time beyond what that is preset for. I like that you can add 30 seconds with the touch of a button. But if I'd had more time (home construction--it arrived and was installed right away) and had purchased it locally where it would be easy to return, I would have returned it and opted for a different model.

It was fairly inexpensive and looks good in the kitchen.  Observations in no particular order:<br /><br />1. The sensor cooking on this is much better than on our old Sharp countertop unit, which overcooked everything.  I had thought at the time that it would be nice if there was a way to calibrate the sensor.  While the Samsung doesn't give you calibration options, it does let you say what you are cooking, and apparently adjusts its response to the sensor accordingly.  I have found that it works pretty well to always tell it I'm reheating pasta!<br /><br />2. A general-use kitchen timer is provided.  Of course most microwaves do, so that's not unusual, but this one is smarter than some.  It is able to function independently of the cooking timer.  For example, if you are timing something for 30 minutes, then decide partway through you want to heat a cup of water for one minute, it will correctly keep track of the 30 minute timer in the background and display it again after it's done with the water.<br /><br />3. Minor niggle: the oven vent is supposed to come on whenever it detects heat rising from below, but ours seems to always need to be turned on manually.<br /><br />4. This is where the Samsung loses a review star.  The Eco Mode feature is poorly conceived.  When you press the button, the panel lights go out and standby power consumption is reduced.  So far, so good.  But then as as soon as you use the microwave again, or even just open the door, or use the oven light or vent options, it leaves eco mode; the display comes back on and STAYS on.  It really should remember eco as a user preference rather than as a temporary mode.  I also suspect this ties in to the problems some customers have had with the control panel failing.  If we were allowed to set a persistent eco mode, it's likely that the front panel would be mostly-off except when in actual operation, and as a result it might not burn out.  We have made it a habit to push the eco button after each use.<br /><br />In sum, it fits with our kitchen decor and cooks well, and we hope we will be able to make it last a long time by remembering the eco button as often as possible.",10/12/2013,1,1

I will say the microwave works well as far as successfully heating items as a microwave should. Other than that, I find it to be an awkward design in the following ways:<br /><br />- The button for the light is directly under the &#34;Start&#34; button. If you hit the &#34;Start&#34; button, it automatically starts microwaving for 30 seconds. However, in a dimly-lit room, I often accidentally hit the &#34;Start&#34; button when I'm just trying to turn the light on. I can' tell you how many times I have started a 30-second microwave cycle on an empty microwave.<br />- Speaking of the lights there are two light bulbs underneath, which is fine. However, in the one year we've been using this microwave, the same bulb has burned out twice, while the other has yet to burn out at all. The first time, we had to scour the internet for a replacement bulb only to find that the specific wattage of the bulb that came in the microwave is pretty much unavailable. Anywhere. So we did some reading and learned to use a slightly lower wattage bulb. This took entirely too much research and hunting for what should have been a simple light bulb.<br />- The beeping at the end of the cooking (or timer) is quite obnoxious. It's 3 long, loud beeps, and, unlike every other microwave I've ever used, it does NOT stop when you open the microwave door! I have young children and often stand directly in front of the microwave, waiting for the timer to hit 1 second so I can stop it before it beeps so it doesn't wake up anyone sleeping/napping.<br />- There are lots of &#34;convenience&#34; setting (quick buttons), but I have never used a single one of them. Seems like a bit of a waste of space and features. It has a &#34;reheat&#34; button, but, unlike some other microwaves on the market, it is NOT a &#34;sensor&#34;/automatic reheat, so I'm not sure what the purpose of it is when you could just as easily enter the amount of time and hit start like normal.<br /><br />Overall, it looks nice enough and works as far as microwaving is concerned, but I personally think it comes with many flaws.",3/6/2013,1,1

We gave up preservative laden pre-packaged bags of popcorn years ago in favor of real kernels using a special bowl or paper bag, so the popcorn setting is useless for us.

Full sized plates fit and have had no issue with container heights (even my large popcorn bowl fits nicely).<br /><br />Bought the white version online at Home Depot, as their price was actually better than Amazon's and included free delivery as well.

Really wish there was a way to adjust this-a bit aggravating to have to hang on to it so I don't shove it off the stand to open the door!

If you have a double oven, then I think you are better off with a standard high quality microwave.    This is a high speed microwave convection oven; but due to the size of the cavity the conv oven takes longer to heat up.  About 10 minutes to reach 350. Once preheated convection works good.      Does a nice job with frozen pizza, rib roast, chicken, etc. This makes really good toast in 6 minutes, 3 minutes per side, you have to flip the bread. But I don't think it saves any time.  Also, when you use the convection oven, remember it has to cool down to use it again as a microwave. That can take another 10-15 minutes.    Bought mine about 4 yrs ago with a 5yr extended warranty. Within the last month, a piece of plastic trim fell off, door handle cracked, and the touch screen started randomly simulating keypresses.    Repair service came out 3x to get the right parts ordered and repaired, maybe it's fixed.  Will find out.    Cooks well.  The best feature is that this is a variable microwave; unlike most units that simply turn the magnetron on and off to vary the Power %, this one actually reduces the power itself... very cool.  This also combines microwave with convection bake and grill capabilities, and you can control the bake temp as well as the % of microwave to use. For grilling you control the microwave % but not the grill temp, as the grill halogen just stays on the whole time.  That isactually a very nice feature.  On my regular oven, the broiler turns off at 500.    So from that standpoint the unit is pretty smart.    Get this on a firesale if you can... get a long term 5yr + extended warranty, you will use it.    As other's point out, it doesn't have program cooking, can't do a delayed start, can't do multiple programs in sequence, doesn't have a meat thermometer, but it does have a lot of pre-sets.  So, it's an OK unit; I haven't really found anything that competes with it.  Would be interested in hearing feedback on better choices.",3/3/2011,0,1

It works great and it looks beautiful. I actually purchased mine online from walmart, but I order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you. I've had mine almost 2 months now. It has a 3 prong grounding plug. It's 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave, so I'm still getting use to that. I'm going to try and address everything I see people asking questions about. First off, when you hit a number, for example 2, it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes. You can press the start button and add 30 seconds. If you want a specific time, for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds, you can press the power button, then the numbers, 3,4, and 5.  It will start cooking 3 min. 45 secs. It has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn, pizza, dinner plate, defrost, etc. It has a normal hum when running. It has a turntable. The clock is displayed in green. It beeps 5 times, not super loud but loud enough, then stops. The light comes on when you open the door and while cooking. It has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door. I've not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior.The handle pulls easily. It has a nice weight to it. I have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it, so I don't know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not, mine doesn't.  The inside dimensions are 12 in. wide, 12 in. deep, and 8 in. high. The turntable plate is 10 1/2 in.  Plenty of room for most things you microwave. For the outside dimensions, the width (side to side) is 19 in., the height is 11 1/2 in. The outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle. The actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back. Here's the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it. I have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in. from the wall. I have it sitting 1 1/2 in. from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space. This means I have it 2 1/2 in. total from the wall. It comes out 15 in. from the back of my cabinet. The front legs sit back 2 1/2 in., which means that it is 12 1/2 in. from the back of my cabinet to the front legs. So, if your shelf is 12 1/2 in. deep, the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in. from the back of your shelf. I have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall, so if you don't, you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1/2 in. deep to give you more vent space. I think this covers everything. I think you'll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave.from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet.

Of course, I know it hasn't been used that long, so I'll be sure to update my review as they use it more.<br /><br />The nicest features of this are:<br /><br />* It's a microwave that also grills and crisps food -- so it really functions more like an oven than a microwave.  It comes with a grill rack, and you can cook meat on it.  When you use the grill function, you can put metal into the microwave . . . but just be careful that you take out the metal once you use it as a microwave proper. The gill function works fine, but doesn't make your food quite as crispy and nice as a regular toaster oven does.<br /><br />*  The crispy plate is also perfect for doing pizzas, and the students who have been using it to cook frozen pizzas have said that they are evenly cooked.<br /><br />* The 1,000 watts make this pretty powerful.  It's good at evenly cooking food, and doesn't leave those cold places in frozen dinners like cheaper microwaves do.<br /><br />*  There are ten power levels and a plus 30 seconds button, so you can easily add more time to your cooking time.<br /><br />* A standard variety of pre-set buttons make this good for doing basics such as popcorn, veggies, and potatoes.<br /><br />* The exterior has a scratch-resistant coating, and the stainless steel facing doesn't pick up smudges and fingerprints like stainless steel often does.<br /><br />The measurements on the 1.1 cubic foot microwave are: 11-11/16 H by 20-3/8 W by 15-13/16 D in inches.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really nice microwave.

But, a little bit after the 1-year warranty ran out, part of the keypad became defective--the numbers. Some of the other buttons worked so we could still partly use it while we diddled around before finally calling the repair technician. He came out, took one look at it and told us that it would be more expensive to repair it than to just buy a new one. Called and complained to GE, and we were able to score a GE credit worth almost the price of another microwave. We had specific space/look criteria, so we had to end up buying the same one. It's only a matter of time before it goes, too.<br /><br />To add another note, my college apartment has the exact same microwave, only in white instead of stainless steel. The keypad also broke one day, and when I called to get it fixed they came out the next day and replaced the whole thing--apparently it happens so often they have a few of them just sitting around as replacements.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 stars because, while it is prone to breaking, it is at least a really functional/attractive microwave and we didn't have to pay very much on a replacement. If you only need a microwave for 1 year or less, it's a good buy. Any longer, which will be most people, find a different brand.",12/3/2012,1,1

It looks great in our kitchen and the stainless steel matches our major appliances.  The black ceramic interior is also a nice touch - looks great and should be easy to clean.  The turntable is a bit larger than that of the countertop microwave it replaced, and in operation the microwave is very quiet.  One downside of this particular unit is it isn't the most powerful microwave out there - rated for 1000 watts compared to other 1200 and 1250 watt microwaves in this price range.  However, it is sufficient for home cooking tasks.  Setting the power and time is easy.<br /><br />The other function we've tried is the convection oven.  We used it to cook some frozen hors d'oeuvres (fancy name for pigs in a blanket) using the included metal racks and ceramic crusty plate.  Even though we preheated the oven as directed, we found we had to cook our food far longer than expected based on the time listed on the package, so there was no real time savings over using our conventional oven.  In addition, the exterior of the unit becomes *very* hot when using this mode.  I suspect that we will not be using the convection mode very often, though it is a nice feature to have.<br /><br />As for the Slim Fry / grilling / combined cooking modes, I have not tried these yet and I'm not sure I will.  These modes *seem* to use both microwave and convection heating, but it isn't clear how much of each from the very short included manual.  It is also very unclear when the included metal racks and crisping plate should and should not be used.  (Even looking through reviews and questions here you can see that Samsung is giving very inconsistent information on this subject.)  In any event, I will take other reviewers word for it that Slim Fry is a mediocre substitute for actual frying.  As for grilling, the grill elements only reach the back third of the oven, and I'm not sure it is worth the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven.<br /><br />So overall I would give this Samsung four stars for microwave cooking, three stars for convection cooking, and two stars for the other functions.  Four stars overall since it does its main job very well.h the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven.

If you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. That was the case in our place. We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. Not fun.<br /><br />Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit. I saw this one and had a Eureka moment. Since it is only about 14 inches wide, I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave. A magic eraser got rid of that.<br /><br />The other minor thing is that when on the laminate counter, the microwave slides when you try to open the door. They should have built this with non-slip feet. I cut a couple of squares of that non-slip grip stuff that's sold just about everywhere and that solved the problem.<br /><br />The inside of this unit is very small. Keep that in mind. It is a tall unit, but the cooking space is not conducive to a tall item. You can put a 4 inch call mug in there with no problem. I would not go above 5 inches in height for any item put in here. 5 1/2&#34; would leave only a very thin space at the top and I don't know how that would work out.<br /><br />These small things are well worth it to regain precious counter space.",7/4/2014,1,1

The good:  It looks nice; the stainless steel finish must have some kind of coating on it because it's much easier to clean than some of my other steel appliances; the overall size is decent on the inside.  When it's cooking, I have to say this is the quietest microwave I've ever owned.    The not-so-good:  I've never had an over-the-range microwave with the handle on the door before and I hadn't really given that feature much thought before making the purchase.  It looks nice and all, but the handle gets untouchably hot if you're cooking on the stove;  I don't think I'd ever buy another with a handle again because it's kind of a nuisance to have to use an oven mitt to open the microwave (even more of a nuisance if I forget to use a mitt and put my hand on hot stainless steel).  It's very hard to see inside of when food is cooking.  There's one bulb and it's quite dim, plus the door has a screen-printed pattern on it that makes it even harder to see into.  The exhaust fan for the range technically has two settings, but they sound almost identical... and it's VERY loud. If the microwave is running for a long period of time or if it starts getting overheated from the stove below, the fan automatically turns on.  It's a smart feature to prevent it from overheating, but again the fan is super loud, and you can't manually turn it off once it kicks on.    The bad:  Oh. My. God.  The freakin' beeps when it's done cooking are INSANE!  I've never, ever had a microwave that didn't stop beeping upon the door being opened.  Not only does this continue, but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5-6 seconds long each!  And if you don't open the door in a timely fashion, it doesn't remind you with a gentle, short beep;  instead you get the same 3 ear-shattering YokoOno-screeching beeps every 2 minutes.  I've found that if you hit the stop/cancel button before opening the door, it'll stop the beeping... but again, it's another nuisance that I've never had to deal with in any previous microwaves.    The other bad thing I've found is that the touch pad scratches EXTREMELY easily.  I only use a microfiber cloth on it and it still looks like I went at it with steel wool covered in broken glass.  I tried using a plastic/fiberglass polish and it didn't do a thing.  However, I've found that using granite countertop cleaner/polish at least minimizes the look of the scratches a bit.

I found that sometimes the clips in the back have a little trouble popping in all the way, unless its lined up just right.<br />I didnt like the wall mount screws a whole lot as well as the fact there is only 4 to hold on the whole bracket (they note that you should have at least 2 in studs).  They have holes drilled in the mount all the way across, so what I did was located two studs, drilled some 1/16th pilot holes in the bracket where they were and sunk (5) 1 3/4&quot; drywall screws in each stud from top to bottom of the bracket to attach it to the wall.  I didnt want to worry about the microwave falling off and either seriously injuring someone or smashing my new ceramic top stove.<br />Also be careful if drilling the top cabinet mount holes with the microwave in place, the bit can easily destroy the screw hole :)  I ended up replacing the two small upper cabinet mount screws with 1/2&quot; self tapping bolts.  So the cinnimon powder doesnt quite sit level up there in the cupboard.. but the microwave is definately not falling out of my wall!<br />As for functionality, the microwave is nice and powerful, the unsightly buttons are hidden behind the door (you punch in the settings when you open it).

Drop a dime in the slot to call someone from a payphone?<br /><br />Anyway: yes, there are metal racks for the microwave and the other function.

You can see in the description all of the functions--and they all work pretty close to as they are described.<br /><br />That's the first real issue with the &#34;Smart Oven,&#34; as the box labels it: the descriptions on the webpage here? They're almost as complete as the instruction manual. There's a bit more, but overall I would have liked a bit more in terms of device ideas and how to utilize it.

On a countertop, it drops down flush but this does require that the oven is a little taller than my previous microwave.<br /><br />Functionally, I'd like a better option when using the grill or Slim-Fry settings than letting the grease/food drippings to just drop down onto the turntable.

If I could give half-stars, I would give the LG a 4.5 at this point. It was very reasonably priced compared to others with similar features, and reasonably easy to install.  It does a good job overall, has some features that the Spacemaker did not have, but also lacks some nice features that the (much more expensive) Spacemaker had.    Here's what I really like about the LG:  1. Multiple speed exhaust fan with timer.  2. More time/Less time buttons.  3. Soften/Melt/Defrost settings work well.  4. Turntable on/off setting is useful for large or oblong cooking vessels.  5. Popcorn, hot dog settings are very accurate.  6. Hold Warm feature keeps cooked items at a safe temp for up to 90 minutes.  7. It doesn't need the clock set just to use the microwave, (like the Spacemaker did.)  8. It works reliably every time I use it!    Here's what I feel the LG lacks:  1. Doesn't remind you after cooking is finished (the Spacemaker beeped discreetly every 30 seconds for up to an hour).  2. Reheat settings are sometimes a bit too aggressive.  3. Can't adjust the volume of the beeps when setting or finishing cooking (default volume is a bit loud).  4. Aesthetically, the black window on the front is not as attractive as the Spacemaker's white window.  5. Although the EZ-ON button starts and adds 30 second increments, a Quick-Minute button would be useful.  6. The turntable is smaller than it could be (although this has not really presented any problems).  7. The Spacemaker had an automatic nightlight feature, the LG does not (this is a small inconvenience).    At this point in its lifetime, I would recommend this microwave.

Every appliance in our kitchen is new and this particular appliance is my favorite due to the uniqueness and convenience of this model. This microwave has exceeded our expectations in every way. One of the reasons we bought this microwave was that we needed a microwave that would fit under the countertop so our kids could reach it. It is also nice that the door slides open and I can reach down to lift out the food instead of having to reach up at face level and lift food out and down. I liked the unique concept of a drawer that pulls open instead of a door that pops open. I was a little concerned about reviews on earlier models that the auto open and close function on this microwave has a tendency to break. However, it seems that Sharp decided to manufacture this one so it closes with a button or by pushing or pulling on it to eliminate that problem. I was also concerned that it didn't have a piece in it that rotates the food. So, we were surprised to find that none of the food we have cooked has hotspots (note: I only use my microwave for reheating...not cooking). I LOVE this microwave. I had considered purchasing the 30 but decided that it was unlikely that I would need to put a dish in the microwave that was bigger than 24. So far, this has been the perfect size. It is even tall enough that I can put my portable mug in it to heat up my tea. Also, my lovely daughter did not know that you can't put metal in the microwave. She put her fork in with her plate. Surprisingly, the microwave did not arch. We checked the manual and it said you can even use aluminum foil to cover portions of meat. Not sure how they do it, but I'm not likely to try it. The microwave seems fine after the fork episode. This microwave also has programmable features such as softening ice cream. It asks what size of ice cream then sets the time as appropriate. It's a nice feature but I'm not usually softening a whole tub ofice cream. Just a portion of a tub. One other feature I use frequently, pushing the power button after closing the drawer will turn on the microwave in one minute increments. As an example, pushing the button 3 times will equate to 3 minutes. This is a pricey microwave but has been well worth the expense in our experience. I highly recommend this microwave!",10/29/2009,1,1

I just bought one today at a big box store at their regular price of $250. I bought the prior model to this one a little less than 4 yrs ago when I bought my new construction house and upgraded to stainless appliances. One day it worked fine, the next it would act like it was working, but the food wouldn't heat up. Microwaves are supposed to last approximately 9 yrs. I am not happy about having to spend another $250 after just barely 4 yrs. Shame on Whirlpool for making disposable appliances nowadays. I will say it is a nice looking microwave, but I agree with other reviews that the fan is useless. No suction at all if you place your hand under the filter. I also don't understand why most microwaves are rated at 1000 watts and every frozen dinner on the planet says it is tested with an 1100 watt unit. ???    On another note regarding Whirlpool in general I have the following to say. I bought all Whirlpool appliances when I bought my house and I will never spend another dime on Whirlpool again. The only reason I bought the Whirlpool microwave replacement is because my house is for sale and I don't want mismatched appliances. When the washer and dryer were delivered and installed the dryer had a noticeable knocking sound that the delivery guys blamed on flat drum rollers. The front load washer has a ridiculous time trying to balance a load during the spin cycle. The refrigerator has more sharp edges that I have cut myself on in the door compartments than you can shake a stick at. It also doesn't cool down a 12 pk of beer in any less than 12 hrs. I tried to cook a ham in the oven and followed the directions based on weight and temperature....cold ham! The dishwasher is ok but I hate the silverware basket. Not big enough for utensils with large handles. Whirlpool needs to wake up and build quality products that are functional and last. Never again.

I highly recommend it!,"I bought the Sharp R-520KS Microwave to replace my old White Westinghouse that stopped working after Thanksgiving.  I did alot of research before I bought this one.  I was worried I wouldn't find a microwave that worked as well as my last one.  The good thing is that I could finally replace my white microwave with stainless steel to match the appliances in my new house.  Now I had an excuse to replace it.  I was looking for a powerful 1200 watt microwave large enough to fit large dishes in, and this one had some of the best reviews, a decent price, and the stainless steel look I wanted.  I also needed a counter top model since I have no under cabinet space to put one.  This microwave works great!  I also like how the control panel doesn't have elevated buttons making it easy to wipe clean with no chance of food or anything getting stuck in the buttons.  It has some nice features like the hot water button (you tell it how many cups to heat), minute plus button, keep warm setting, and many others.  I've probably used the hot water and minute plus features the most.  There are sensor heating buttons, reheat buttons, and defrost buttons, although I haven't had a chance to use them as much yet.  The ones I have used so far work great!  My only minor complaint is the same as everyone else's, the buttons all look the same and the start/minute plus button and stop/cancel button are located in the midst of all the other buttons making it difficult to distinguish them quickly.  Not too much of an issue, but it would have been nice if those features were located on the bottom or the corner of the display and were different than the others.  It wouldn't keep me from purchasing this microwave since everything else is great and I'm sure I'll get used to them soon.  The microwave is also pretty large, so you can fit alot in there.  I've heated a cup of water and a dinner sized plate of food at the same time.  All in all, this microwave works great, looks great, and was reasonablypriced.

A bit difficult to install.","Our over the range microwave died suddenly in our new home.  I was not the original purchase of this particular appliance, and it was over 10 years old.<br /><br />So I began looking for product replacement.  I found a Whirlpool model online that had some nice ratings, but when I went to my local big box store to purchase, they didn't have the exact Whirlpool model I had read about.  What I found, was this model, which I assume is the newest version.<br /><br />The microwave has a very nice finish.  The door and front feel fairly sturdy.<br /><br />Operation is simple.  I tend to hate overly complex controls.  I want power and simple controls.  This microwave meets my needs in this regard.  This microwave has lots of power.<br /><br />Now the bad.  The install.  This is my second microwave install.  My first being a retrofit of an over the range fan.<br /><br />My first install, and noticing the hardware of my current broken microwave.  The units are mounted by a rear wall bracket that holds the bottom part of the microwave.  And the top of the microwave is held by a couple of suspension bolts fixed to the cabinet.  The USUAL location of these bolts are the two front corners of the microwave.<br /><br />The rear bracket is usually the same size/shape as the rear of the microwave.  This makes it fairly easy to just place the bracket on the rear wall and push up until the bracket touches the cabinet.  No measurement really necessary.  This Microwave has a small bar hanger.  So you'll need to be very accurate with a measuring tape to figure out where the bottom of the Microwave will sit against the wall.<br /><br />I tend to not trust myself in this regard.  So I taped the bracket to the bottom of the microwave.  Held the microwave up against the wall, and had a helper draw a marking line with a pencil.<br /><br />The second negative.  Usually the suspension bolts are at the front corners of the microwave.  In mounting position, my current defective microwave has boltsin the corners.  I could have taken the other microwave from my other house and I suspect the holes are in the same position.<br /><br />On this microwave, one bolt is about 3 inches in from the edge (which is slightly offset).  The second bolt is about 7 inches in so it is offset quite a bit.  Both holes did not line up with my current microwave mounting holes.  So to mount this microwave I had to drill new holes in my cabinet.<br /><br />So take this into consideration.  I bought my unit as a floor model return.  I suspect it was returned for this very reason.<br /><br />Otherwise I've been happy with this purchase so far.",11/4/2012,1,1

Pros:  a major consumer magazine rates Whirlpool tops in reliability.  At its price this is, as expected, a pretty basic microwave, but fulfills our needs.  It heats well, is (in black) quite attractive, the microwave and fan are quiet, controls are convenient for basic operations.  Cons:  one of the installation templates is printed on the cardboard packaging, the edges of which shred when cut, making the template difficult to use accurately.  The bolts supplied will not work in a deep cabinet and it took trips to four hardware stores to find longer replacements.  The instructions did not include an option to hardwire the electrical connection, so I had to swallow hard and cut the cord without knowing what I'd find once I had (turned out not to be a problem).  I exhausted through the wall, but there's an outlet for internal exhaust, and it opens upwards towards the ceiling.  And I mean OPENS.  There's no grid to keep small objects from falling into the body of the microwave from the cabinet above.  This is atrocious design!  I used some semi-rigid plastic screen and clear silicone sealant to protect this area.  The user instructions which come with the oven are totally inadequate, and Whirlpool's website doesn't seem to have any more.  Just as an example, it says to touch COOK, enter the number code of food item, enter quantiy, then touch the Start control.  But there's no list of food item codes.  I'd still recommend the microwave for those who are willing to deal with these issues.<br /><br />Update:  I contacted Whirlpool:  It turns out the food item codes are behind the door.  I guess I should have noticed, but it would be nice if the user instructions referenced this.  As I wrote above, they are very cursory.",2/20/2013,1,1

(We actually have the black version, but it is otherwise identical.)  The Samsung obviously shares the same basic design as the GE with a redesigned front panel.  I knew and trusted the Samsung brand from our personal electronics (such as several smartphones), so picked one of these up on sale at a local retailer.  Unfortunately, what I got was a bare-bones minimal redesign with major flaws.  It's like they took the basic GE design, made it super cheap, and replaced the panel with a terrible non-intuitive redesign.<br /><br />Installation was easy - I was even able to use the original rear mounting plate as the Samsung was, indeed, a twin of the GE series.  This microwave fit perfectly into our 30 wide opening with very minimal gaps on each side.  I had to drill new holes through the cabinet above, however, as the top was slightly different.  The height is 16 for the main cabinet, 16 5/8 to the very bottom of the light box underneath (not shown in the picture, but it's there).  I plugged it in and quickly realized that this sure isn't the same quality as the GE was.<br /><br />The first and most annoying thing is the user interface on the front panel.  The buttons are hard to interpret, and things that are easy on the GE are now impossible or very confusing.  Heating a beverage is common, right?  No beverage button on this unit - you need to discover the button to press is COOK, and then wait for the slowly scrolling text to confirm you are correct and need to press 1 next.<br /><br />What about canned vegetables?  There's a VEGGIES button, so this should be easy.  Not so!  Press the button, and across scrolls: SELECT ... (pause) ... 1 FOR ... (pause) ... FRESH ... (pause again) ... VEGGIES ... (um, I know it's vegetables, I just pressed the button!) ... 2 FOR ... (yet ANOTHER pause) ... FROZEN ... (darn, guess it must be 3) ... VEGGIES ... clear ... SELECT ... (oh no! where can frozen veggies be?!) ... etc.  At least the SELECT doesn't scroll when it appears, only when it's scrolling away.  But the worst part is seeing the VEGGIES on the display, alone, as I wait, knowing full well I pressed the veggies button.<br /><br />And I still have trouble figuring out which button is for the fan and which is for the light.  Making it worse is that there is one button for the light (HI/LO/OFF) and 2 buttons for the fan (ON/OFF and 4 speed).  Actually, there is another button each for some obscure settings we never use.  Sure, there are some tiny dark grey letters showing which set of button is which, but those are only visible up close in bright light.<br /><br />Gone are the easy 1-button 1 to 6 minute quick start buttons.  Now it takes 4 button presses to do the same thing, although at least there is still a button to add 30 seconds.  I could go on and on about the poor interface, but I think you get the idea.<br /><br />Next major issue: the stovetop light is way dimmer than the GE was.  Even though there are 2 places in the design for bulbs, and my GE had 2 halogen bulbs, this one has a SINGLE incandescent bulb - not bright at ALL.  This is huge, as we use our stovetop frequently and now it is always poorly lit.<br /><br />And a another biggie: when the timer finishes, it gives 4 short, quiet beeps, and stops.  No repeat, nothing more.  So unless you are right by it, it is pretty much worthless.  We can now only use our oven timer - so no more dual timers when we are cooking different things.  I can't even count how many things have overcooked or been ruined because of the lame timer.<br /><br />The look is also unattractive.  The lightbox hangs down below the lower front plastic panel, ensuring everyone knows how tacky this microwave is.  Even the display is an ugly old-fashioned blue 14-segment per digit 7-digit display.  Most calculators have better!  Actually, I kind of like the blue.  Everything else in my kitchen is amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.  It frequently makes weird grinding-like noises from the bottom right (I think it is a fan or the microwave element) - if I tap it there it usually diminishes or goes away for a while.<br /><br />Finally, the front glass broke once when we were opening the door a couple of months after getting it.  Samsung did send out a repairman within 2 weeks and repaired it under warranty and it hasn't happened again in the many months since.<br /><br />Is there anything I like about this microwave?  Well, it works.  It has a turntable.  It has sensor cooking.  And it has dual grease-filters on either side of the bottom with a powerful exhaust fan (that has 4 levels when not using the microwave, 2 when in use).

My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling 鈥?which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called 鈥渙il-less鈥?fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald鈥檚, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I鈥檇 still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I don鈥檛 know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. It鈥檚 part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else.

Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power.<br />&#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel.<br />&#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them.<br />&#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.  (This is the same principle as a pressure cooker).<br />&#62; Stir some oil (e.g., olive) oil with cut vegetables---a coating of oil will help hold the steam inside the individual pieces of vegetable.<br />&#62; A selection of glass casseroles of a range of sizes with glass lids can be essential for microwave cooking.

There are 6 one-touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press. It also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start-up or while the microwave is already running. There are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting.<br /><br />It looks really nice - much better than I was expecting. Pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle, and a black casing. Looks like it cost a lot more. Easy to clean, and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front. One difference from the picture -- the key pad is all black, and not white and black as in the photo.<br /><br />The 0.9 capacity is just right.

If your microwave is like mine, with a turntable, the (factory) paint wore off in the path of the little wheels that turn the glass table.  (NOTE: My oven is at least 10 years old.)  I read the paint can's directions thoroughly, scraping off all the old, loose paint and rust.  The paint says use it in a well-ventilated area; I suggest you wait for a nice, low-humidity day and use the paint outdoors.  (It smells quite bad.)  Make sure you allow the paint to dry thoroughly before bringing it indoors; I also waited 24 hours before re-installing the turntable and using the microwave.<br /><br />Results:  Within 2 months, the paint had been worn off by the turntable wheels, and I'm back where I started before painting.  So -- I guess if you're repainting someplace that will NOT get any wear, this paint will work fine.  Under turntable wheels, not so much.<br /><br />PREVENTION ADVICE:  Make sure your microwave oven is clean and DRY after each use.

A lot of the reviews I have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges. Samsung (or whoever the Samsung dealer on here is) has only added to the confusion, unfortunately.<br /><br />First, a few points to set the record straight. The appliance is NOT covered in stainless steel. There may be a bit of it in the trim, but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn't actually sen one in person. Most of the outside has a black, textured metal finish, which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances. It may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though.<br /><br />There is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction, which is limited to the trim, &#34;open button&#34; and part of the door latch. I have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance. In fact, the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside. Some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode, which is not true. The rack can be used in the combination grill/microwave mode just fine and your microwave will NOT burst into flames. From the manual, page 11: &#34;Grill Rack, to be placed on the turntable. The metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking&#34;. It will even &#34;work&#34; in the microwave-only setting, although it won't contribute to the cooking process at all. In fact, the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave AND grill at the same time, and you can't utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place.<br /><br />This brings me to the main point of my review. Those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave. This is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison. Is it heavier than most stand-alone microwaves? Of course it is, because it has an entirely separate heating element, electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior. This is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta, pizza, crusts, etc. The additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than stand-alone microwaves, which is entirely understandable to me. This also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavy-duty microwaves. If used with the grill though, it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating.<br /><br />Adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of stand-alone microwaves on the market. The reason for this is pretty simple. To keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance. Without the heavy-duty (which is necessarily heavy) inside and outside finishes the device has, it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned. For those who wonder why it doesn't have more capacity or more wattage, the reasons all boil down to safety. You can only add so much shielding to keep the size (and cost) of such an appliance practical. I think that Samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety, size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does.<br /><br />In regards to cost, I have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks. At one point I believe it was $179 (shipping included). Then it went up to $230 (shipping NOT included). Today, it is down to $199.99 with free shipping. I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is, but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries, it seems like at bargain to me.<br /><br />For me personally, this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things. The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen, ever. It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone, actually. All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though, because it is definitely more expensive than a stand-alone microwave. If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill. I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though. I am too spoiled with this product's cooking ability at this point. In any event, I think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here.
