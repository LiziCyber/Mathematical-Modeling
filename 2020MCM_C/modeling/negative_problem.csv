He has 3: the giraffe, the monkey, and the puppy, but this is his favorite. We put them in his crib at night and if he wakes up crying, he finds one, puts it in his mouth, and goes back to sleep about 90% of the time completely on his own. He's been able to put them in his own mouth for a couple months now. In the morning, he wakes up and collects all three together and plays with them for about an hour which lets us sleep in, another huge plus :). If he's tired or fussy, his wubs soothe him right away. Because of the little animal attached, he doesn't lose or drop it very easily at all, and it gives him something to hold on to which is very comforting for him. He also loves it for teething now. I am very confident that learning to pick these up on his own and put them in his mouth has really increased his manual dexterity. They wash really easily in the washing machine and you don't even have to stick them in the dryer because they dry so fast. The only downside is if you have pets the hair may stick to the pacifier part, but we don't have this problem. Did I mention we get TONS of compliments on how cute they are? You really can't go wrong with these little guys!!! They are probably my favorite of all our baby items :).",12/4/2010,1,0

Unfortunately, we didn't introduce them until 18 months and switching so late in the game was not going to happen. I wish I had known about them earlier.  The price is a little crazy but if it saves you the orthodontic costs later in life I guess it is not so expensive after all :)<br /><br />My almost 2-year old has had a pacifier addiction since birth. Since around 12 months she has only been using one for sleep.  She prefers the Soothies to the exclusion of all others. Since she had begun teething, she was chewing on them and biting small holes in the newborn Soothies that she preferred (0-3 month) and we had to replace them almost every day.  So, we started buying the stiffer 3+ month Soothies.<br /><br />At her 18-month pedi appointment he noted that her teeth were developing crookedly.  I had noticed this myself so was not surprised with the report.  He suggested switching to the orthodontic kind. We bought binky after binky hoping she would give one a chance. The clear silicone ones were not going to happen.  She would look at them, yell at me, and throw them on the floor.<br /><br />Fast forward a few days:  I saw these online, the price was steep but it was the opaque type of material sort of similar to the Soothie so I bought two sizes 0-6 months and the 6+ months (she prefers the size and texture of the newborn pacis).  She put it in her mouth for a few seconds and spit it out.  Then she refused to take it again.<br /><br />We now give her the 0-3 month Soothies again(luckily she stopped biting through them after a couple of weeks of intense teething).  They are much less stiff than the 3+ month Soothies and her teeth are looking better but not perfect.  I do think the stiffness was a big part of the problem.<br /><br />Although I am sure that other parents would disagree, taking away the binky is not an option in my mind due to her level of attachment.  So, I put it into perspective:  there are way worse things than crooked teeth.  As the pedi said, this is crooked teeth, not cancer.  Enough said.n option in my mind due to her level of attachment.

I wanted my LO to use the Nattursutten pacifier because it's made of all natural rubber and is one piece (no space or hole for bacterial growth) but even though I purchased the butterfly shape, it was so big that it covered my LO's nose. And my LO is quite large for his age so it wasn't because of his size.  Other moms complain about the same design flaw, too.<br /><br />My second choice was the Gumdrop pacifier because although it isn't made of the same high quality material as the Nattursutten, it was one piece so again, no holes for bacteria to grow in.  But the pacifier was so heavy that my LO couldn't keep it in his mouth and I didn't want my LO to have to use so much force when using a binky.  Just logically speaking, I would think the LO's jaws would hurt from holding something so heavy for so long.<br /><br />So then I tried Advent and Dr. Brown which were lighter in weight but also covered the nostrils.<br /><br />I ended up using MAMS pacifiers only because they were super lightweight and didn't obstruct my LO's breathing at all.  But they are a pain to clean- the part that the LO sucks on is hollow so soap and spit get stuck in there.  After awhile, it turned murky in color despite my obsessive washing.<br /><br />As soon as my LO was older, I again tried the Nattersutten.  Still same problem- covered his entire nose.  Back to Gumdrop and thank goodness, this time, my LO was able to hold it in his mouth on the first try.<br /><br />I'm still not 100% satisfied with it because I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy and why the nipple is hollow (makes cleaning a pain).  Oh and the design makes LO look like Hannibal Lecter.  It's a bit disturbing to me.  Haha. But for now, my concern about bacteria growth in the MAMS binkies outweighs these issues.<br /><br />Until Nattersutten creates a pacifier with a deeper dip in the nostril area, I recommend the Gumdrop version.",12/27/2014,1,1

Having a video feed, in addition to the audio, is wonderful.  This monitor does an adequate job of displaying a good angle of the room and is pretty clear even in the near dark.  In my opinion, the video doesn't have to be high definition, but simply good enough to give an idea of what your kid is doing.  This monitor does the job, and does it well.<br /><br />2. After about 11 months of use, the monitor would not take a charge.  Playing around with it, I determined that the wall charger was fine, but the battery would not recharge, or continue to work even when plugged in.  Even though we may have been out of warranty (we received the monitor as a gift well before the twins arrived), I called Motorola and they agreed to replace the monitor for free.  Much more than I expected from customer service.  So although it failed, Motorola was responsive and took care of the problem.  Since then, we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />3. The user interface isn't perfect.  For example, we have twins and purchased an extra camera for a second room.  While we love the ability to add extra cameras, and the possibility of setting the monitor to automatically cycle through the cameras, for some reason you cannot change the video feed while the volume or brightness control is on the display.  And there is a huge lag in the time it takes for the volume control to clear the screen after you hit the button.  Often, we'll hear one kid crying, pick up the monitor and turn up the sound, and then have to wait several seconds for that to clear before changing to a different video feed.  While this may seem like user error, or a small inconvenience, I'll be the first to admit that we aren't always thinking clearly at 2 a.m., which also happens to be the time when I have the least patience for the volume control to clear so I can change feeds.  This isn't a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.  It has additional features, like the ability to play music and speak through a microphone to the camera.  I've never used these other than to make my wife jump when she is putting away the kids' laundry.

It's possible I would think more highly of the soothie if I had not tried the Pigeon pacifier first.  My baby  will take the soothie but does not prefer it over the pigeon one.  The problem with the Soothie is that it falls out of his mouth really easy.  If he lets up sucking for a moment it falls out of his mouth.  If it happens to roll out of his cot (which seems to happen more frequently than a regular pacifier) it always lands teat side down (regular pacifiers are more likely to land teat side up).  Additionally there is no cover for the soothie and it is more difficult to teather to a stroller or car seat so it is not a great pacifier to travel with.

The loop rubs against baby's face and sits right where their mouth is wet. Just makes for a chapped face waiting to happen. SO, my solution, I used my husbands drill and drilled a hole in the tab and looped a Booginhead through that. Im sure you could use anything to put the hold there. If you do this, make sure its a SMALL hole and its low enough down to the base you dont have to worry about it breaking.<br />There are also some by Bella Tunno or Ulububu that clips on the tab. These don't hold too well but I guess its personal preference if you want a clip that slips or a loop that can chap :D<br />Personally, I think Soothie should put a hole in the tab themselves. :) Problem solved!<br />So, long and short of it, I think these are the best!!",8/27/2015,1,0

He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did!<br /><br />When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own!<br /><br />UPDATED JULY 2013<br /><br />I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm.",5/14/2013,1,1

(not recommended).  i am not saying this to discourage you to buy this seat, rather i think you should educate yourself on how to put an infant into a car seat well in advance of the day you decide to take the baby home from the hospital!!!  since then, obviously we figured it out. and now we love this carseat.<br /><br />i own both the boulevard cs 70 and the marathon versions of the britax seats.  the boulevard is considerably more &#34;luxe&#34; than the marathon. i like that the seatbelt clicks. at first, i hated it because i felt like it was way too constricting when it squeezed against my baby. but now i feel like i need that comfort of the click to know the seat belt is on properly.  the marathon that i have does not have the click feature, and i never feel like it's on tight enough.<br /><br />we decided to not go with the infant carrier seat, and i am very happy with my decision to not get one (despite a lot of protests from my friends).  a few words of advice for those of you choosing to use only one convertible car seat from birth until they outgrow the seat...<br /><br />1.) newborns need a full recline! otherwise their heads roll forward and can constrict breathing.  we had to get towels and prop the seat up so that the seat would fully recline properly in our car<br /><br />2.) when the seat is rear facing, and in newborn recline mode, it may not fit in your car right. especially if you are tall people that require the driver seat and passenger seats pushed all of the way back.  my husband is 6'4&#34;.  this is a problem for us, because the seat couldn't recline completely and thus, the baby's neck was constricted.  we actually bought a new car all because of this!!! not exactly the most economical approach, but we wanted a new car anyhow.<br /><br />3.) the cushions are essential to get with your convertible car seat so that you can properly get a ball of a newborn baby to fit into the seat right.<br /><br />4.) i highly recommend getting one of those inserts that wraps around the baby's head so that the head doesn't fall from side to side.  that was a huge problem for me at first because of the lack of neck and head control in those first months.<br /><br />5.) if you are in a bumpy ride (think a jeep wrangler, or a sporty subaru impreza with stiff shocks), then don't get a seat like this for a newborn. their head is going to bounce all over the place in the car seat.<br /><br />6.) it takes some practice to maneuver the newborn into the car seat because of the lack of head control.  you have to sort of hold the baby horizontal, and slide them into the car seat sideways. it's annoying but possible.<br /><br />overall, it's possible to do this from birth on, but there are definitely considerations that need to be made when making that choice!",11/7/2013,0,1

It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it.

The tag lists the filling as PP Cotton which is a tricky wording for Polypropylene filling. I've also seen some of the stuffing coming out of the seams which also confirms that it is definitely NOT cotton filled. The fiber filling is probably the recycled material part of the bear as Polypropylene is usually used to manufacture plastic beverage containers. This explains why other reviewers comment on how light & cheap this bear feels; if you've ever had a cotton filled stuffed animal then you may recall that cotton filled animals usually have a heavier feel to them while those stuffed with synthetic fibers feel more light and airy. I feel that the manufacturer has been very misleading in their description of BinkiBear since they state that BinkiBear is 100% cotton inside and out.<br /><br />The other qualm that I have with recommending this bear is that the pacifier is very hard to attach/remove. I feel like I may accidentally rip the bears arm off trying to fit the pacifier through the loop. The problem is that the loop that secures the pacifier is just a bit too short so it's a very tight fit trying to thread the pacifier through it. The problem could be easily remedied by the manufacturer by simply making the loop longer allowing more space for the pacifier to fit through or they could modify the design so that the pacifier is secured by a button, snap, or Velcro closure instead. Perhaps they don't all have this problem and we just received one with a short arm.<br /><br />Like I stated earlier the product is well constructed and the bear does wash well so if you don't care about the materials being 100% natural then maybe this bear will work OK for you (hopefully you'll find the pacifier easier to secure). If you're like me however and want something made of natural material instead of synthetic then I would recommend taking a look at the organic binkie towel dolls by Kathe Kruse. Despite my disappointments in the product my son is quite taken with binkibear so we will not be returning this bear.

The little lamb (and it is little) is precious and you can't help but say awww when you first see it.  It's a great concept, and any parent that has played the retrieve the binky game is hoping it will work.  So far for us it's been about 50% successful.  The little lamb's feet are slightly weighted, so if our daughter is lying still in her rumble chair and you get the binky in her mouth and the lamb spread out right it does work.  The problem is at 11 weeks she's not exactly lying still all that often but she doesn't have the hand control to hold on to the lamb.  She still has the whole arms-swinging-wildly startle reflex going, so more often than not she knocks the lamb, which pops the binky out of her mouth, defeating the whole purpose.  She can't control her hands enough yet to then get it back in.<br /><br />On the upside, it does prevent the binky from rolling off onto the floor and it makes it much easier to find and put back in her mouth.  I can see the potential for this product and hope when she gets older and can actually hold on to the lamb it will work.  I'm giving it a 3 star rating for now for cuteness and potential and hope to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star rating in the future.<br /><br />Update: A year later and I'm afraid this little lamb never really worked out for us.  By the time my daughter had enough hand control to no knock the lamb out she was keeping a binky in her mouth more readily and she would grab this little guy to examine and again, pull the binky out of her mouth.  We ended up using binky leashes, which were perfect for our needs.  She recently rediscovered this little guy, and while she's too big to need him, she did enjoy popping the binky in and out of her mouth a few times holding the lamb, but then became angry that the lamb wouldn't give up his prize. =)  At this point, this guy is holding on to one star from us for sheer cuteness and one for what COULD be a great idea for another child, but I'm afraid he never quite worked out for us.  (We have friends who swear by him however, so it may work for your child.)<br /><br />As a note: it would be nice if there was some way to attach and detach the binky.  If she had used this frequently I could see it getting dirty and needing to be washed, which would be tricky without getting laundry detergent on the binky.

I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his/her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look...

We were looking for something light weight that would stay in the baby's mouth, as opposed to the gumdrops which we were forever putting back in.

Baby has also been able to get the Paci back in her own mouth because it is so light weight. Te gumdrops would pop out so fast.<br /><br /> Cons: it is easy to get shoved up closer to the nose (as earlier reviewer said) but it hasn't been a terrible problem, since we are always with her. Also, the comments you will get about the look of the Paci will be endless, since this is a newer Paci and it's not mainstream yet. (Not really a con...just be prepared to explain to people!). It doesn't fit like a normal Paci: It doesn't really touch her face, so she does have to suck continuously. This hasn't seemed to bother the baby too much.<br /><br />Overall, we are pleasantly surprised with this new find.

 i would give them 6 or 7 stars.<br /><br />they combine all of the good features of the other brands into one product, with none of the flaws that the other products have.<br /><br />i love these bags!<br /><br />okay, so here's the low down on these:<br /><br />- this is the new version of honeysuckle's breastmilk bags, which are designed to be used with a pump--you just pump right into them.<br /><br />the bags have little holes on the top part, so that you can attach them to a pump adapter.  so, for the full experience, you need a pump adapter or two, which you can get by purchasing a pack of bags made by your pump's manufacturer.  i bought these medela bags: [[asin:b007pexokw medela pump & save breastmilk bags with easy-connect adapter - 50 ct]] because i have a medela pump.  i don't know if adapters are interchangeable between brands.  then, use the medela bags if you want, so that you're not wasting, and so that you know how wonderful these honeysuckle bags are when you start using them.  whether or not you use the bags, keep the little plastic adapters.<br /><br />then get some of these honeysuckle breast pump bags, and you'll see how perfect they are.<br /><br />medela vs. honeysuckle<br />all right, so here are the reasons that i like this bag better than the medela bags:<br />1. the plastic is not as rigid as the medela bags, yet it is still thick enough that you don't have to worry about it.<br />2. get this: the honeysuckle bags fit the medela easy adapter better than the medela bags do!  with the medela bags, you have to put them on at just the right angle, and it's kind of a tight fit.  then removing the bags after you've pumped is...well, interesting.  the honeysuckle bags are easy to put on, and they still stay put while you're pumping, but then they are easy to remove when you're done.<br />3. the honeysuckle bags can be stored flat in the freezer so that it is easier to store more, instead of having a bunch of squatty bags like the medela ones.  or, you can store them upright if you prefer.  another nice thing about storing them flat is that they defrost more quickly when you're ready to use them.<br />4. the honeysuckle bags can fit more milk.  they are marked to 6 oz (medela is marked to 5 oz), but since they can be stored flat, there is also just a bunch of extra space.  so, if you fill a little more it doesn't create any problem.  the medela bags get kind of messy if you put any more than 5 oz.<br />5. the honeysuckle bags have two seals.  medela only has one, and it doesn't always seal perfectly.<br />6. the honeysuckle bags are much, much less expensive than medela bags: right now (based on the cost of packs of 50 bags on amazon) honeysuckle bags are about 23 cents each and medela bags are 40 cents each.  so, medela bags are almost double the cost of honeysuckle bags.<br /><br />those are the things that come to mind.<br /><br />lansinoh vs. honeysuckle<br />1. the lansinoh bags cannot attach to a pump directly.  so, you either have to pump into something else first or hold the bag the whole time you pump.<br />2. the seams on the lansinoh bags are thin--honeysuckle's seams are very thick, so you really don't have to worry about them splitting at all.<br />3. lansinoh bags are meant to be stored flat, which is great, but they are awkward to try to stand up (when you're filling them or actually using them). honeysuckle bags can also be stored flat, but they have a special bottom of the bag that makes it so that it can stand up well too.<br />4. lansinoh bags are partially sealed at the top, which is supposed to reassure us that the bags are sterile.  honeysuckle bags are completely sealed at the top, which is much more reassuring.<br />5. the label area on lansinoh bags is upside down (so that they are right-side up while in the freezer, maybe?).  regular honeysuckle bags have the writing right-side up, which i think is nice---but! these pump bags have no writing, so you can do your own thing, and if you want to put it right-side up or upside down, either will work.<br />6. lansinoh bags are considered the cheap brand; right now on amazon each bag works out to about 21 cents.  at only 23 cents each right now, honeysuckle bags are very comparable in price, while the quality is far superior.<br /><br />i am aware that there are a few other brands of bags out there, but i haven't tried them.  i started with medela bags, switched to lansinoh but didn't even finish the package of those, switched back to medela, started buying non-pump honeysuckle bags--which are also very good, and just heard about these.  i won't be switching brands again, because i can't think of anything i would want to be different.<br /><br />if you're considering these bags, i definitely recommend that you buy them.  you won't regret it.  the only thing that is kind of a pain about them is that they are not available in any stores near me, so i have to get them online.  that just means i have to plan ahead a little, but i can handle that.  every time i order bags from honeysuckle (this was my third order), i have received them within a few days, so shipping time is also minimal.ice---but!

Little did I know that the hospital would stick a binkie in my baby's mouth as soon as he came out to the world.<br /><br />At first (my son's a preemie) they had to cut a portion of the paci so it didn't block his airway - this thing was almost 1/2 the size of his head. I tried switching him to other pacis, useless, either he couldn't grip it, or he'd spit it out.<br /><br />We didn't have any problems (like other parents) with him latching to the paci, only to breastfeed - but if you do have problems - try tickling/stroking their chin/jawline. It made my kiddo open up to feed, but with this paci, i think he could smell it a mile away.<br /><br />I can TOTALLY see why he'd like this, the nipple is shaped like a real nipple.

Every chain/grocery store were sold out, and what we did find, we bought all of. As soon as we lost one or couldn't give one to my son when he needed it, the world literally would end.

As a last ditch effort I decided to try pumping, but my little one refused to take the medela bottles we had. I found this set at Walmart in white and figured it was worth a try since my son takes the MAM paci. He took the bottle instantly and I've loved them since. Here is my breakdown of pros and cons<br />PROS: - the vented bottle does help with gas, its like I have a whole new baby and we are getting to enjoy the smiles that we love to see! Note: he still has gas but there is a marked change in how he handles it grunts vs. Crying and screaming<br />- the nipple shape is easy for him to use and doesn't seem to bother him switching from the bottle to me when I want him to nurse.<br />-the sterilization feature is awesome! I didn't want to buy one of those bulky sterilizers and I'm busy enough as it is with my family and baby, so 3 minutes in the microwave and done!<br />- super easy to clean! These things come completely apart in 5 larger pieces, it takes no time to clean and I know I didn't miss anything<br />- they are easy to re-assemble, just pop the silicon ring into the base, screw on the body (make sure the threads are right and its tight to prevent leaks) pop nipple into neck then screw onto top! I found these much more user friendly than other anti-colic bottles. Even my beloved Born Free that I used for my first son can't stand up to the MAM.<br />-did I mention they have helped the gas issue?  Because that's the most important part for me :)<br />-I like how much this set comes with for the low price, I should note the pacis are 2+ month so they may be a little big for newborns.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-they can leak, most of the time its user error,  note what I said early about watching the threads, I have done it a few times and accidentally dumped half the bottle on me and the baby, but once I figured out what I was doing wrong I've had no more leaks.  If you are super groggy at night, you may want to have some bottles already put together so you don't have to worry about it.<br />- I wouldn't heat liquid in them. My hubby has with no issues,  but I just don't trust it. Its easier for me to reheat the bottle that I pumped in and pour the liquid into these. Besides the wide bottom doesn't fit in some warmers.<br />-the numbers aren't the easiest to read especially if you care about anything less than 2 ounces.  For me, this hasn't been an issue to cause much concern.<br /><br />Overall I love the bottles, they are cute and more functional than I could hope! Amazon does seem to have the best price,  so I intend to purchase extras here",7/15/2013,1,0

I have been using them for a few months now and am not very impressed. First, the name of them is suitable because they are so top heavy that they tip over all the time. The bottles are also hard to clean since there is an apprecable lip inside the bottle that collects residue that I can't seem to get with the bottle brush. I end up putting my fingers in there and cleaning it. Lastly, they are incredibly expensive. I won't be buying them again and will instead be switching back to Avent (which we used with our first baby with no problems).

(which you will want to do with caution as the picture illustration is backward to how it really has to go together and if you dont pay close attention you could try to force it in wrong and break it). if your crib has wide top railings or round top railings then this mobile will not work for you as the arm has a lip that helps secure it that will not work on wide sections of railing. <br /> <br />i still rate this a 5 because for us we had no problems at all and it really is a beautiful mobile.",4/8/2005,1,1

If you squeeze the two sides of the case, it instantly pops open. I barely have to put pressure on the case and its quickly open. Yes, I realize the latch should be easy to open but I found this way worked and seems to be a great way. This easily fits two soothie pacifiers in the case.

I have 4 main complaints:  - The strap between the baby's legs is a simple narrow strap so it kind of digs into him. He is cushioned by a diaper, but he is definitely applying pressure to the strap because the back always forces the baby to be semi-reclined  - only a single cup holder for the parent - no place to put keys, phone, etc. I bought a separate caddy [[ASIN:B000SMWUPS Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy]] that velcros onto the handlebar and that works well, but that was an extra $15 or so.  - The canopy sort of snaps open because it resists opening and then all of a sudden opens. Same with closing, but slightly less dramatic snap. When my baby is sleeping, I hate to be opening or closing the canopy since it's so loud. But my baby generally sleeps though it so it's not much of a problem.  - The shoulder straps are difficult to adjust, or at least I haven't figured out how to do it. If you can't just grab something and intuitively figure out how to adjust it, it's not a good design.

(maybe not only as a baby monitor). lastly, it had the vox feature that i didn't know too much about but it got me interested. it said something about noise cancellation and i wondered how that would work. lastly, i was very excited about the ptz feature on the cameras.<br /><br />as for design, i believe samsung's monitor looks sleek and elegant. the black on white really makes the monitor look like a quality product. the overall design of the camera, the color, and shape of the monitor is sharp, and the four way directional button to control the camera is very convenient and easy to use.<br />why i decided to go with samsung: i purchased the sew-3037 because of three reasons.  as a company, i trust samsung. they know how to make electronic products. i love their tv and i love their phones. i figured, they'd do a great job on this as well. secondly, the overall image quality, the ptz feature, and the vox feature. lastly, the monitor being expandable to four camera system.<br /><br />after receiving the monitor: i love it. i tested it for a couple of days and i can't stop playing with it. the overall video and audio quality on the camera is very good. the range hasn't given us any problems and we have a pretty sizeable house. i don't believe it's available now, but i definitely plan to purchase more cameras. the vox is a great feature. it saves battery so you get a good couple of hours on the monitor. it also keeps things quietly and goes into sleepmode when my daughter isn't making any noise for a minute or two. then it comes alive again if she stirs. you can set the sensitivity and also turn it off all together.<br /><br />the feel of the cameras and the monitor is solid, not flimsy at all. the color and design is as i thought, very sleek. i love the look of the camera. i'm thinking i'm going to find other uses for it even after my daughter gets older. i think this was a great buy and definitely will recommend it to my friends.",11/17/2012,1,0

He became attached to it very quickly and wouldn't take any other pacifier when we were suppose to transition him off of it. But I thought no big deal what could it hurt. Well he is now 5months old and he did what they he could do. I had read of babies being able to stick the whole thing in their mouth n I too was a little skeptic about it but today he accomplished it! N thank goodness I was holding him when he did it because I had been putting him to bed with it and it could of been a lot worse. So yes some moms say that they have older babies taking it with no problems which might be the case BUT don't take the risk! Because when your baby starts teething like mine they want everything in their mouth and they get aggressive with it and believe it or not but they can fit it in their mouth!

And - believe it or not - it did all those things. HOWEVER - my son totally hated the pacifier. We had been using every brand of binkies, so I figured what's another new brand? Right? WRONG! We had used nuks, playtex, avent, etc. All with no problem but the soothie pacifier attached to this wubbanub is HUGE. I am not kidding. Not just huge on the outside plastered on your little one's face...but huge like a giant long nipple too! Coupled with the fact it was ugly as sin it made for hilarity at starbucks one day when all the other mommies watched in horror as I proudly pulled out my new fancy wubba to give to my little one and he proceeded to choke like a bulimic after thanksgiving. AND, the poor little dude kept giving it the old college try because he wanted the sucker and I let him because I forgot back up. I just kept praying he'd make it work. It was all very sad. Long story much shorter I sent my hubby to babies r' us to pick up as many small stuffed animals as he could find. That weekend I bought velcro and we created our own wubanubs. Here are 3 major benifits to making your own:<br />1) you can detach the pacifier and wash it for REAL. As well as wash the buddy it is attached too! Unlike the wubba. IMPORTANT - The wubbanub DOES NOT come apart ( very gross and stupid)<br />2) you can use whatever brand of pacifier your little one enjoys, a major plus if you actually want this whole learn your paci is attached to a frog thing to work.<br />and<br />3) Compared to the ugly things my little macgyvered knock offs look amazing.

It is ideal for breastfed babies. That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals.<br /><br />Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings/warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there.<br /><br />Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it):<br />1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab.<br />2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with.<br />3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his/her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and/or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one.<br />4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size!<br />* (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing! Before it was a newborn 0-3 month size, and then a 3/6month -18month size. Now the second size is simply labeled as 3+ months. Still the same pacifier, just new packaging to make sleep-deprived moms feel even more crazy....)",8/23/2012,1,0

Let me count the ways:  1.  One piece construction means they are easy to clean.  We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.

I decided to give this one a try, hoping that maybe if the paci fell out, it would still stay close enough for her to get back in her mouth on her own.  No such luck.  Also, when she starts vigorously sucking, she gets all excited and starts to pull on the animal, causing the paci to come out.  My sister had one of these with her DS a couple years ago, but I remember the animal being a little more weighted than this pink bear... per another reviewer, perhaps the quality has changed a bit over the years?<br /><br />The nice things about this paci is that it's cute as heck.  Also, when the paci does fall out of her mouth, it doesn't go too far - a problem I had with the paci alone falling on the floor and then me needing a few backups on hand in case I couldn't wash it right away.  I think this would be great for on the go - less likely for this bigger thing to fall out of the carseat (I don't think I quite trust a paci leash with my DD being this little).<br /><br />The one thing I don't like about this is that you can't remove the paci from the animal, so it makes washing a little tricky.  I'm used to having to sterilize everything daily for a preemie and this one you can't really throw in the dishwasher or in the steam basket.  The only way to sterilize is to dip it in boiling water and trying not to get the animal wet.  Based on reviews, doesn't sound like a good idea to throw this guy in the washing machine.  Plus, I'm not sure if I would want my DD's paci in the washing machine anyways.<br /><br />I am hoping as she gets a little bigger and if we decide to stick with a paci, that this will work out better for us.  But at little over 2 months (over 2 weeks gestation), it's not quite as great as I had hoped.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it soon will!",2/20/2013,1,0

What I mean is if you are in the car and he's hungry and you need to buy 10-15 minutes to get home to nurse, letting him suck on the pacifier will keep him from a total meltdown. It also is invaluable if he has missed his sleep window and needs the soothing of sucking to settle him down.

You might want to put a bit of lipstick on before your gloss. But your lipsticks will absolutely be the color they are in the tube. No more problems with the ones that turn color on their own. You are free to pick out the color you like. And all lipsticks will look smoother than ever and stay on. And really truly, no feathering or bleeding. I don't even try the others any more. I do put it in my purse for after lunch. That is the only time during the day that I wear it off.

I had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose.  Unfortunately, after about a year the blower switch broke right in half.  I bought this one to replace it.  I like that the dryer is reasonably priced so I didn't feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one.  This one has a couple of manufacturing changes, though, that I felt were downgrades. First and foremost, this one has a 6' cord, where the previous model had a 9' cord.  The cord doesn't swivel, so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement, whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap.  Second, Remington changed the direction of the blower switch, rather arbitrarily, so that up is now off instead of high.  I know this sounds petty, but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and I couldn't see a good reason to change it.  It probably won't be a problem for you if you didn't have the earlier model.    The drawback to the original, which is still a drawback on the current model, is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when I'm back-brushing I don't have good control over the hair.  On the earlier model I felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow-power this model definitely fits the bill.    I ended up coming across a BaByliss Pro Porcelain Ceramic that I could try before buying, and even though it cost more I bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare.  It has the longer cord, heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn't blow quite as hard on the low blower setting.  Since I was having to re-learn the controls on the T-Studio anyway, I figured I might as well get a longer cord out of the deal.",6/8/2011,0,1

This blow dryer is one of the best available at major retailers today.

The d5000's compact size makes it easy to hold, and it won't take up much space on on your bathroom counter when you're done with it. Although it's touted as a travel dryer, I find that it makes a great daily styling tool, drying my damp hair in just a few minutes (Caveat: I have fine, medium length hair, so someone with longer or thicker hair might need something more heavy duty).<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is that it's kind of loud.

The problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and style.<br /><br />I wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50% of hair drying quickly, but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish. This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways. If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don't care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer. With my medium-fine hair, I just can't get that polished set that I'm looking for. My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I'm planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry. However, I don't like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished.

In all honesty, I never use the hanger. I leave my cord dangle. It actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet. If I hang the cord, I actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess. That may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger.    The nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe. If you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light, you will notice the room is much brighter at night, but the light is no brighter than any other night light.    You will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200W to 1600W as this does not come with the dryer.     I had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated, so they may have fixed that problem.    This dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875W regular handheld model. It's not silent, but it is quieter than any dryer I've owned.    Even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage, I don't notice a significate increase in drying time (maybe a minute or two). I actually prefer the lower wattage now because I'm not blasting my hair (or scalp!) with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use (I don't curl or use a flat iron, so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers). Also, once I finish blow drying, my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day (an moderate amount of volume), whereas with the 1875W dryer, my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day.     Other notes: The dryer itself is a medium size. I like that it's not one of the tiny ones because I feel like it's not flimsy and weak (even if smaller ones really aren't). It's also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers, so I find that I move it around much more and get more even drying.",3/9/2010,1,1

I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.<br /><br />This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).<br /><br />I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic.

My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.",1/1/2012,1,1

When I got it though, did that remain true? Yes! the length of the cord might not be the longest but it isn't short either- it's a rather standard size I suppose. It works perfectly like any other blowdryer. I think the only reason I am putting four stars at this point is because after being so into the reeling feature , the reel started having problems about 2-3 months into owning the blowdryer. Was it serious? No, I can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine. So if this isn't going to be a problem with you I'd recommend it.

The Andis is more feature packed (see my separate review). The Conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers I've owned including the Andis model. I used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference, the Conair was only 76db vs. 83db from the Andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers. The Conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair. There are 2 heat settings (low & high) and a cool setting. The cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button (no heat at all). The air intake on the back is a 1-3/4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen. The opening is a bit small when compared to the Andis model which is larger at 2-3/8 inches and has side air intakes as well. This begs the question of reliability of the Conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the Conair model, this could cause more heat build up of the motor. Only time will tell. The unit has 2 blower speeds, although I wish it had 3 for more versatility. The velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models. Air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the Conair and 198 degrees on the Andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached, all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory. The retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet + 3 inches with 5-1/2 inches that does not retract into the handle. The retracter is a bit stronger than the Andis model but it will still require you to help feed the cord all the way to its end. The dryer does come with a 3 year warranty but the Andis model comes with a generous 5 year warranty. Both the Conair and the Andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same.  My favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.favorate choice between the two models is the Andis because of the longer warranty and the design & feature advantages it has over the Conair (see my separae review) but given all the features of the Conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment, I give it a solid 3.5 stars.",4/25/2014,1,1

As other reviewers have stated the area of cord where it comes out of the handle wears out and short circuits causing pops, sparks and fire! This happened after 1 year of use almost to the day. I live alone and use it once/day mostly on high heat. The problem is obviously a cheap cord that when bent back and forth enough times will wear the wire enough to short out. This is not a fluke but  bad design components. When I compare the cord to other dryers I clearly see the difference in cord. This cord has more of a softer  rubber feel and a dull dark color, where proper cords have a shiny finish and more of a hard vinyl feel.

I found it at walmart for $35, which wasn't the most expensive one that they had, but I've used John Frieda products before so I figured it would be a good try. So far, I really like this dryer. It feels like it could be a lot more expensive.<br />I compared it to my mother's $80 or so hairdryer and it actually keeps up with it pretty well. I really like how the engine feels and sounds. It works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap-o hairdryers have. It doesn't shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn't get QUITE as hot as the $80 blowdryer my mom has, but it's pretty great at it's job because my hair actually looks better when I use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one. It definitely fights frizz very well.<br />The only problem I'd say I have with it is that it's a heavier dryer than my old one that broke. I say problem because people may dislike that but I prefer it that way. When dryers have a bit of weight to them I feel like they've got a stronger motor. Not to mention I really don't notice when I'm using it.<br />As for the people complaining about the buttons, I can't say that I can relate.

This is the same socket I've used for several different curling wands, straighteners, hair dryers, battery chargers and even Glad plug-ins over the last eight years. The plugs on all those items fit the outlet just fine. The plug on this dryer will fall right out of the socket six or seven times in the five or six minutes it takes to dry my hair. VERY frustrating! I usually sit a heavy book about 8 inches out on the cord to hold it steady then shove a vase against the plug to keep it in the socket.

I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day.

That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.

My least concern was this I just wanted to be sure I was getting the Evolution and not some other model with the name Evolution  on it.  First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say best hair dryer ever. no need for the low setting as the high is perfect, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?  I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE>?  Why are not you all saying the truth.  I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down???  The cheaper dryers, yes.  But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  But I can get that at the local drug store for 30.00  Pleaswe people, THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  I have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even maybe..THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so light air flow I thought my electric ay be the problem.  So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  Are you kidding me people?  This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE and I for one will never EVER trust this company again. They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.

This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.

I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent this.<br /><br />The hair dryer includes three different heat settings- I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.

I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage and monthly blemishes.  I have maybe had 2 facials in my life so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid, or any other kind of acid for that matter.  I have used the product about 4 times now.  The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face.  After the fourth use it's at the point where it still burns but it's not unbearable and I can last the whole 10 minutes.      Although the peel is painful it has definitely been worth it.  I was afraid I would have a lot of dry skin on my face which would show through my makeup since I have semi-dry skin already but it honestly wasn't that bad.  There were probably 3 small dry patches but you couldn't see them through my makeup and after the second day I used a dry washcloth and wiped the dry skin off.  My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone.  Before I would never go out in public without makeup on because I felt like people could see my age in the condition of my skin but now I have no problem going out with a clean face.  I have used a number of products of all price ranges in the past to minimize the hyperpigmentation and nothing ever worked.  This is the first product I have ever used with success.      If you can't stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results.  Also, it says to use lotion after using the peel but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.    I gave this product 4 starts out of 5 due to the pain.  As far as effectiveness is concerned it deserves 5 stars but the stinging is really unpleasant.",12/4/2010,0,1

We have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn't skipped a beat! First time we used it, we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting PVC pipe, so as far as heat goes, this thing is awesome. Its heat resistance is also pretty impressive! We have had it right up next to  about 1200掳 F and it kept working (it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to PVC pipe, but the PVC funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off). Today we even had it next to about 1300掳 F and not a thing went wrong! So all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn't failed us yet. We've ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time. Only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it, the back started to smoke. We thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we'd need a different one, but soon after it stopped and hasn't done it since. We were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance, so don't use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle. Once it started really raining, we moved into a garage and continued using it, and after that it stopped smoking. But all in all I'd say that it is a very good purchase for a low price.

I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn't limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended!",6/14/2011,0,1

I researched many of the new T3 and the Drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price. I actually bought a T3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand. I had found the Elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general.

It's relatively lightweight (though I wouldn't say it's featherweight, but it is quite a bit lighter than most dryers on the market), dries hair faster than any other dryer I've used, and generally creates smoother, shinier results. I love that you can pop-off the back and replace/clean the little air filter, since most of my dryers in the past lost power over time because the filter got clogged with dust and I couldn't clean it.

If it's quiet, it's a big bonus.<br /><br />My favorite is this: http://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Ionic-Conditioning-SI745/dp/B00007M1U2/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t , the Sharper Image ionic hair dryer. I like the travel version because it's light weight, yet delivers just as much power and air. Too bad this is no longer in production.<br /><br />I also enjoyed this: http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Infusions-Wahl-Pro-Dryer/dp/B001E6G6FC/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top , and I use it as my alternative hair dryer when I can't access my Sharper Image dryer. This one, too, delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently.<br /><br />Now, to our product at hand... it's heavy compares to the two I had just mentioned. It's not any more quiet. I don't generally use the air diffuser on my Wahl, but I do use it on my Sharper Image. I tried using the diffuser with this Remington, but whether I use it or not, my hair gets very tangled afterward, which isn't a problem with neither of the two I had mentioned. It also does not dry quickly as the title implies, nor does it make my hair feel anymore healthy than before I use it. In fact, rather than taking half the time to dry my hair, I think it doubles the time.<br /><br />My hair is past the middle of my back, so it's a bit long. Maybe this is a great dryer for shorter hair? I don't know. I can't recommend this to others.

The only reason why I gave it a 4 and not a three is because you and me both have the responsibility of keeping our hair away from the back end of the hair dryer.

Not only was the design almost identical, but the comb and brush attachments were identical and, in fact, would interchange perfectly with my old unit.  If that is the case, this one should also last for many trouble free years.  It does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion.  The unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds.  The fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything.  A check with my ammeter revealed, however, that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position.  I am not saying that this is any kind of a problem, but I just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds.<br /><br />I would personally question the part about the &#34;ionic&#34; feature &#34;breaking up water molecules&#34; to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do.<br /><br />At any rate, it was just what I was looking for and does a great job.",2/25/2014,1,1

I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  It worked fine and I had no complaints. I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  I didn't see any improvement in frizz when using the dryer. I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don't remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer wouldn't work.  I pushed the reset button on the plug and it wouldn't reset. I pushed the reset button on my outlet and it was working.  I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  The tag on the plug said I should refer to the user manual.   I found it on Conair's website but it was not helpful (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer). So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring. I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer. HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair's headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     I'm really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH) the dryer has stopped working.  I'm also disappointed that I have to go through a rigamarole to have the dryer replaced.  With today's technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer. They could also send me a prepaid shipping label and not charge me shipping and handling for a new dryer.      Maybe I just got a clunker, lots of folks like the dryer.

I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website.

The dryer has a nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap, but isn't overly cumbersome either. It dries my hair very well, and seems to keep frizz to a minimum thanks to it's lower heat and air settings. The dryer definitely makes noise on high, but it's not as loud as most I've encountered, so for me it's a non-issue. The attachments included seem to stay put for me, I've had no problems with them falling off or coming loose while using the dryer. The switches have a solid feel to them, are well placed too, reducing the chance of accidentally changing the settings.     One difference I've noticed compared to other dryers I've used is when changing the heat settings on this dryer, the fan motor doesn't speed up or slow down any at all. With other dryers if you turn the heat up the fan sounds like it slows some, and turn the heat down the fan sounds like it speeds up a little. Perhaps that is one of the advantages of having an AC fan motor instead of a DC motor that is wired into the heating elements via a rectifier circuit in the hair dryer, less stress and voltage spikes/sags to shorten the life of the fan motor.    The only issues I could think of is the cord is not as long as I'd like it to be. Another 2 or 3 feet of length in the power cord would make a huge difference for the better.     The low heat setting on the dryer seems to be cooler than the low heat setting on all the other dryers I've used i.e. it's barely warmer than ambient air temperature. Whether that's a plus or a minus should be left up to the individual user. For me, it works better this way, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.",5/7/2009,1,1

The Tan Towels were just getting to be very pricey.  I found that these ones work just as well as the others! However, it seems like it takes a few more applications with the Loreal brand to get the same color as Tan Towels, but for this price that hardly matters.  Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  I used these every night for 3 days and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  Not too dark at all and not overly noticable.  These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  I'm not sure you can call this a deep dark tan, but that wasn't what I was looking for anyway. These take a bit of practice to use (since you can't see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy. Always use a circular motion! Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me).

It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster.

This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.<br /><br />My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer.

Well Worth the Money!!!,"I have long hair, that is about half way down my back.  I've never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry.  Lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if I air dry it, so it doesn't look as nice, and I've started blowing it dry most times I wash it.  Previously, I've only purchased a couple of hair dryers, and I don't think I spent much money on them.  I have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me, I did a little research before buying a new one.  I never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer.  I mean, aren't they all the same?  I soon learned that the answer is NO.<br /><br />This is still a fairly new product, so there were not a lot of reviews to go by.  I did research on what to look for in a hair dryer.  It was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer.  Tourmaline? Ceramic? Well, ok, but what about nanoe?  It seems that Panasonic is the only one using this technology right now.  Infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers?  I was definitely skeptical when I read that.<br /><br />I knew that I definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat, and the Panasonic EH-NA65-K has that.  I was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments.  The nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when I was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer.  The Panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for.  They are nice attachments!<br /><br />As I said before, there were only a few reviews out there, but what was there was nothing but great reviews.  What the heck, I decided to give it a try and I must say that I'm very pleased.  This hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one.  I also really noticed how much I am used to the quietness of this the last time I got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair.  It was way louder.  This also dries my hair much quicker, which is really nice.  With the amount of hair I have, it takes a while to dry.  Most of the time I am using the quick dry nozzle.  I also found that I didn't need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer.  I just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when I'm done.  As for the flyaways, it didn't completely solve that problem, but it does seem to make that better too.<br /><br />After using this hair dryer the first time, I thought my hair looked a little darker than normal, and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since I know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair.  The next day, one of my coworkers asked me if I did something different to my hair.  I asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal.  I have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before.  I couldn't believe it!  I didn't tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer.  That told me that what I noticed must have been true.<br /><br />To summarize, I am very happy with my new hair dryer.  It hurt to spend this much money at first, but now I think it was well worth the cost.  Now I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer.  This hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one, due to the nanoe port on the top.  Between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer, I don't really want to take it with me when I travel.  I travel for business about once a month a really miss this hair dryer when I'm gone.<br /><br />Panasonic, please make a Travel Nanoe Hair Dryer!",9/19/2014,1,1

And I couldn't be happier!!!  My hair is:    1). Straight  2). Smooth  3). NOT Frizzy  4). Shiny  5). Volumous  6). Looks like I just got a blow out at a salon    Let me start at the beginning.  My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?

No problem since there are communal hair dryers I can use.  That day I found out how underpowered this HD was compared to other 1875w dryers out there.<br /><br />My hair is thick with a slight wave to it.  I like to get it as straight and clean as I can.  I don't like frizz, I don't go crazy with styling, I don't do the 'just out of bed' look either. I had been using this dryer for a little over 2 years with the concentrator.<br /><br />While true enough, it did dry my hair and I could get it relatively straight (as long as it isn't very humid), it took quite a bit of time and fussing to get it that way.  And by the time I was done, I had a bunch of small hairs going every which-way on the top of my head that I would need to smooth over with product.<br /><br />If I needed my hair perfect, like if we were going out, that means I left it in a Turbie for 30-45 min instead of my usual day-to-day 10 min.  That way it comes out relatively straight with little frizz (again, dependant on humidity) I guess if you take that into consideration, this works fine if you have loads of time in the morning.  Me? I like my sleep.<br /><br />Now, the air was hot enough but the amount of air that was coming out was not, even on the high speed (which it was on for 2 years!).  I wish I would have figure that out back then and exchanged it for something else.<br /><br />There were two features on the dryer that I could not tell you what they do, they never seemed to work or show a difference in styling for me: the Ion switch and the cold air blast. My hair dried just as slowly with the Ion switch on or off and the cold air blast was never cold or room temperature, it always just felt like the hot air was coming out.<br /><br />My other complaint is the attachments for it.  The diffuser and the concentrator.  I think I used the diffuser once but it suffers from the same, if not a little more, complaint.  The attachments are held onto the dryer by a little hump of plastic.  With any force, they pop right out.  Very frustrating when you're trying to get the dryer and a brush through your hair and the concentrator keeps popping off and falling on the floor.<br /><br />I did like the rubber hook on the base of the dryer, it came in handy for hanging the dryer on the side of my vanity when not in use (before I started packing it for the gym).

From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too.",3/27/2008,1,1

I showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that I contact consumer affairs for Remington, which I just did. Since it has been over 30 days I can no longer return the appliance to Amazon.

Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn't had that problem with this dyer, and to me that's saying A LOT.<br /><br />John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It's well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it's designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here's my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...<br />The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.<br /><br />She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.<br />The only really `con' with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it's not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use).

I won't buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  The filter is easy to remove and clean It also isn't too heavy.  The color is cute, although I don't know if most men would like it.<br /><br />On using it, it has good power, and it's not too noisy.  It also doesn't get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that's not bad.  If you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer, this is totally doable.  And it's cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  The cord is a good length.<br /><br />The retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn't come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  It's a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.<br /><br />All that said, I have two issues with this product.  The first is minor... there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up!  I keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet, and it's an annoyance that I can't hang this there.  And because the cord is retractable, you can't really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.<br /><br />The second issue is more significant.  I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  It gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it.  I can't say whether this is a problem will this model, or just for some reason the one that I was sent.  But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.<br /><br />This dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of ionic, tourmaline etc., I don't see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I'd rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.

My hair is thick, with a wave, and it absolutely mushrooms after blowdrying or in high humidity. It takes forever to dry my hair, so naturally your weary arms tick up the heat factor to get it DRY already, and that in turn ups the frizz factor.    I must say, I was impressed. The dryer features several heat and style settings, so to give an honest portrayal of the results, I kept the heat on the equivalent settings as my usual blow dryer. Then, after a while when my arms would usually get tired, I increased the volume setting.    Unfortunately, with this blow dryer, I wasn't faking the exhaustion in my arms. This isn't the heaviest blow dryer I've ever used, but it's up there! If there was such a thing as getting muscled from using blow dryers, I'd be Ahnold already. I wasn't faking it when I reached the point in the blow drying when my arms were saying, Enough already!    The dryer is more than enough power to accomplish the job. What was interesting was after my hair was dry, it really WAS less frizzy than the same routine done with my usual blower dryer.    The second time I tried it, it was raining out and about a billion percent humidity, the perfect laboratory for determining if all the tourmaline/titanium/ceramic add-ons actually worked to keep hair smooth.    It kind of did. What I can say was my hair frizzed, but it frizzed LESS, and it was much shinier than I've ever seen my hair in humid weather. I guess that's an endorsement, but not enough of one where one might forgo a flat iron to flatten out the kinks.     The dryer comes with a diffuser, which I've always found to be WAY too much work and time (if your arms hurt with regular blow drying, you'll be crippled when you're done using a diffuser on thick hair!)    If you're in the market for a blow dryer, and you have a problem with the frizzes, you might want to give the Remington serious consideration.

Anyway, after calling back I spoke with another woman who said to mail the dryer at my expense($9.00) and they would send me another dryer.

The only issue i had with it (when it was working) was actually just an inconvenience/design flaw - as another reviewer said:  The buttons are on the inside of the handle and are the toggle style.

I thought i was getting a cheap dryer, but overall it was VERY expensive:  If I bought a new $11 dryer every six weeks, that would be over $100/year - I could spend half that on a really nice hair dryer that would last years!<br /><br />The return policy expired but i could mail it to Conair ($12 postage) along with a check for $7.00 and then wait weeks for them to decide if they wanted to repair it or replace it (maybe they would, maybe they wouldn't).  So, then i would have $30 into a hair dryer that, if they choose to replace it, would be replaced with the same junk that would last another few weeks?????

This one came up with the most reviews in this price range. I know I shouldn't but I wash and dry my hair every day. I needed something reliable but under $30.<br /><br />The first thing that bothered me was that I received an obvious return which doesn't bode well. I've tried this for a couple days so the jury's still out but right away here's what I like and don't like about it:<br /><br />PROS<br />-very quiet<br />-lightweight<br />-useful attachments<br />-multiple speed options<br />-cool shot<br />-ability to clean filter<br /><br />CONS<br />-nozzle is longer<br />-matte finish makes it slippery to hold<br />-cool shot button is much shorter than older Conair<br />-easy to accidentally press/hold cool shot when you don't want it<br />-speed/heat button sliders very cheaply made<br />-filter is hinged and doesn't open all the way<br /><br />For price and value, okay buy. If you have short arms like I do, the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual. Also, since it's slippery to hold, you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem, if like me, you have arthritis issues. With the old Conair, I could lazily hold it however I want. I could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1/2&#34; and you really had to push it down to use it. The cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily. I'm also worried about the settings buttons. It does not seem very secure and/or there is only a small attachment in the middle. In other words, as you slide them, the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit. They actually stick out a little bit (are not completely flushed against the handle). Whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen.<br /><br />Overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap.

The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn't feel as hot as I would have liked.

The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn't get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn't blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.",3/2/2011,1,1

I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer.

This blow dryer worked fine for 18 months. However I heard a shriek upstairs when my wife was drying her hair. She said it was on fire and she had unplugged it. I could smell the burning smell. Later that day I started wondering why it hadn't blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire. I did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if I had solved problem. No!  After about 10 seconds smoke came out, there was a burning smell, and the handle got hot. Obviously this is the last of this product for us. The warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing.

I can't compare it to other hair dryers that claim to be super quiet. However, I would say that is misleading. It is not super quiet, but it is more quiet than our regular hair dryer. A negative for me is the placement of the control/setting buttons. They are right where I place my fingers to grip the base of the dryer and because the switch sort of softly rolls up down to change from both high-medium-low and from cool-warm-hot, I often unintentionally switch from hot to cold. I had to concentrate to hold my fingers away from the switches, away from where they would naturally rest. This hair dryer's switches should be made in such a way that they do not change so easily. A more gear-like switch (that firmly clicks and stays into separate positions) might have solved this design problem.",1/5/2006,0,1

Both dryers have negative ionic technology, which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels, the gym, and my therapy pool, as I always notice much more frizz when I use those dryers than when I use my own. So, in that regard, they鈥檙e both preferable IMO.<br /><br />Unlike the Conair, the Curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to, and for me that鈥檚 so that there aren鈥檛 large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair. It may be that I have a heightened sense of safety awareness, after working in health care for 38 years, but the Conair鈥檚 clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn鈥檛 give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for 鈥減ixiecurling.鈥?For those who don鈥檛 know, this is a method of drying curly hair, developed by someone who goes by 鈥減ixiecurl鈥?on naturallycurly.com, in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer鈥檚 diffuser with the dryer off, turn it on and dry that section of hair, then turn it off before repositioning the dryer: because the dryer isn鈥檛 on when you do the scrunching, curls stay better defined, but another factor is that your hair isn鈥檛 being pushed away by airflow when you鈥檙e positioning the dryer, only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer. I was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling, but used the method Jessica McGuinty (of Jessicurl) uses in her hair drying video &#60;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyyOypbTHI0&#62;, and it worked great! My hair dried a lot faster, curled really well, and I had no problems with frizz as it finished drying. Although it鈥檚 a little difficult to attach initially, the diffuser works really well, and that鈥檚 no biggie since I have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it, it just resides on the dryer. So one for Curlipops.<br /><br />It has three heat settings: cool, warm, and hot, which are independent of the airflow speed, as well as having a cool shot button.

So I give this one to the Curlipops too.<br /><br />Both dryers are listed as having the same weight, according to Amazon, though that鈥檚 really the shipping weight. It鈥檚 a little more than I鈥檇 like, considering I have fibromyalgia, and I don鈥檛 need any help making my arms and shoulders ache, but it鈥檚 still better than getting hypothermia, pneumonia, or bronchitis. Also, not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means I can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair. Both still weigh less than my mother鈥檚 non-ionic, folding, travel dryer, which I used once while I was moving her, then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created.

This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn't blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn't worry too much because it didn't take very long to dry my hair.  If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  I have not tried this in a humid environment.  I highly recommend this dryer.  Update on 2010-10-17: This dryer is still working great and I still consider it the best dryer I've ever used.

This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!",6/15/2007,-1,1

She has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time.   After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.      I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3.  No such luck.  She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes.  When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again.  She's been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.     Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two.  Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn't use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.     The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature.  The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees.  Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.      The Revlon was much less consistent.  Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees.  I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife's hair.  I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one.  Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.      Both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past.  The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels.   The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side.  From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels.  These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.      The Revlon did push out more air.  On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3.   On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.      Bottom line:  The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife's hair.  If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it's 1/10 the cost on the T3.  But, right now, there's no way my wife is going to give up her T3.",1/13/2008,1,1

It dried my visiting sister's long curly hair in about half the time she says it usually takes her.

There is apparently no app with this information available either. Neither is there a formula for figuring out how to Slim Fry additional foods other than those listed in the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide. This problem persists throughout the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide in that every function other than straight microwave or straight convection cooking does not give enough information to be able to choose the correct function and setting for foods other than those listed.

I stated, I don't exactly have access to your internal database, now do I? So, no additional cooking info publicly available. I guess if I want to try to Slim Fry frozen cheese sticks, I'll need to contact Customer Service and ask which setting to use because apparently, in the world of frozen food, Pre-breaded frozen Fried Okra is equal to that of Frozen Prawns [shrimp], Breaded. That's the example food for Slim Fry option 2 as per the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide.<br /><br />I asked if there were sheet pans, cookware, or bakeware available to be purchased from Samsung, or elsewhere, that were known to fit in the unit; specifically sheet pans. Standard size 1/4 (quarter) sheet pans won't fit because the 9.5 x 13 size is determined by the usable flat surface area and not the outside of the pan itself. No standard 9.5 x 13 sheet pan is 9.5 x 13 on the outside dimensions that I am aware of. SO, where would I get pans that fit? Apparently Customer Service, nor Parts, has a clue. Who makes the inside of an appliance, capable of being a convection oven, too small for standard size bakeware? Toaster ovens don't count - but they do at least have after-market sheet pans available out there that fit in them. If I'd wanted to make cookies on pans that small, I'd have expressed interest in a convection toaster oven to make 6 cookies at a time, not a convection microwave oven. It should also be noted the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide makes a big deal out of you Choosing the Proper Cookware. This is covered from pg 22 to pg 25.<br /><br />I was told by Customer Service, initially, that what I was looking for was available, and to contact Parts about those last two questions. I did. I checked online and I called. The girl who answered actually hung up on me after I insisted that Customer Service had referred me and that indeed those parts should be available. After she ended our conversation abruptly, I brought the absence of those parts to the attention of the Customer Service rep I was chatting with.<br /><br />Other than the above, the straight microwave function and straight convection function work well. The drop-down oven style door is a really nice feature. The blue display lighting is pretty.<br /><br />How does a company make a product without giving the consumer, or providing to the consumer at an additional charge, adequate instruction or equipment to use their product? I just don't understand how someone puts out a product with 1000 uses and only reveals 20 of them. Obviously people like me don't test them out or question the developers or designers or engineers before putting a product on the market without adequate instruction or equipment to use their product.<br /><br />Obviously, my logic is lost on Samsung - or it's too complex a logic for someone who works there to have figured out. In any case, with a hefty $249 on sale to $399 full retail price tag; the MC11H6033 1.1 cu.ft Counter Top Convection Microwave with SLIM FRY is definitely not worth the money since you can't use it to it's full potential.<br /><br />Review Update:<br />So, as of Christmas Day, I still hadn't found a commercially available sheet pan that actually fit inside the unit. My mother gave me an old broiler pan that she had for a long gone oversized convection toaster oven.<br /><br />I was using just the convection oven feature on the unit for the first time (I'd only used the Slim Fry feature to that point) to cook a dish for Christmas dinner; all of a sudden it just stopped working. The unit head cut off and there was no display visible. I thought maybe I'd tripped the breaker. I unplugged the unit and checked; I had not tripped the breaker, but I turned it off and back on just to be sure. I plug the unit back in and nothing. I've been found something else to plug into that outlet so that I can make sure the outlet was in fact functioning correctly. It was. I then pulled out the owners manual and proceeded to the troubleshooting section. It recommended unplugging the unit for three seconds and plugging it back in. I unplugged it, and left it unplugged for a solid five minutes. I plugged it back in and still nothing.<br /><br />For a unit this expensive to conk out while using one of the features for the first time, definitely says nothing good about the unit. For the unit to conk out while making Christmas dinner; that was just a headache I didn't need that day. I would dub this a completely unreliable unit.<br /><br />I regret that I never did have the chance to try french fries using the Slim Fry option.",12/4/2014,-1,1

When you cook at 50% power, it cooks at 50% power rather than cycling on and off at 100% power, for 50% of the time.  This makes a massive difference on how things cook.  We previously had a GH5184XPS with Accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking.  It was starting to not look so nice from normal use, so I decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one.      After the new microwave was installed, I tried a cup of water in it.  When I started it, it sounded like an arc welder, and when I looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is, it looked like an arc torch flame.  I quickly turned it off so it wouldn't burn the place down.  They took it back and gave me another.  The very night we got it, we were making popcorn in the special Microwave Popcorn bowl, which we had used for years with our other microwaves.  Within a minute, we got an F7 - Call For Service code.  They offered to exchange it for a new one, but didn't have another, but told me they could sell me the new 5184, and updated model of our old one.  I noticed that the new one had a broiler, slightly different menus, $50 cheaper, and we had good luck with our previous 5184.  However, after it was installed, the cook said, this doesn't cook right.  I checked it out.  The updated 5184 no longer has Accuwave.  That isn't how it was represented, so I gave them their $50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory.  That went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time, the magnetron noise would stop, the fan speed up, the light got brighter, and the food stopped cooking.  Since the chicken was still pink, I added 2 minutes at full power, and immediately received an F7 code.  The problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation.  You don't get the F7 until you try to start it again,and the magnetron doesn't start.  We couldn't trust it with chicken.  We avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the F7 codes.  As time progressed, we could do less and less.  Now, you can't even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal.      That was enough for me.  There is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory, so there is no point in getting another new one.  Thus, I decided I would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that WILL work.  The dealer-recommended warranty repair source wouldn't take the job when he learned which model it was.  Whirlpool got another company to come the following morning.  They put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it, and could find nothing wrong.  They said their manual doesn't even list an F7 code.  There is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water.  I went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about F7 for this microwave model, with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot.  Then I put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an F7.  Included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes, but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board.  The on-site techs did not follow the checklist, and called the factory.  The factory told them they will send them a switch to try.  (I was hoping it would be the thermal switch, but the techs indicated it was not.)  The on-site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid-cycle.  The factory came back with, as it gets hotter, the switch contacts may be increasing resistance, causing the problem.  I could repeat the F7 at will.  They did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the F7 error.  Next Wednesday, the switch is scheduled to be delivered, and the techs will be returning to put it in.  The service company also had little confidence in the factory's recommendation, but they have to do what the factory says.  Perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn't take the job for this model.      I've been through 3 of this model, and 4 installs, since April 5 2011, and I don't have a good microwave yet.  They've eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth.  Now it's my turn.  I will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised, on real food, or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value, that works as advertised, for free, and with a new warranty.",6/22/2011,-1,1

A guy came out, dismantled it and said a key part needed to be replaced (he noted 'switches' on the service order dated May 15th).  He said it would take 3-5 days so he came back a week later, without the part, saying he just need to tighten some wires.  It worked for a few weeks, then started to heat only intermittently.  Called the service company again, and a guy came out and jiggled the door, saying there was a problem with the switches, but that they didn't need to be replaced.  It worked again for a few weeks, where I had to keep jiggling the door, and finally stopped heating altogether.  Now, knowing that there was a problem with the switches, I expected the guy to arrive with the needed part.  He came but again, no part, saying he just wanted to confirm it was the switches and that the part had already been ordered.  After not hearing anything for a few weeks, I called back and was told that 'Sharp parts were backordered'.  When I told her it was a Samsung, she didn't look up my order but just said she would look into it and call me back.  After not hearing anything again, I called back and she said the same thing (Sharp is back-ordered, correction it's Samsung)and said she would call me back.  Again didn't hear back so called Samsung.  The escalation department reviewed the situation and I was put in for an exchange because the process had gone on so long.  She said I would get a call from someone who would review options with me (when I asked what the options would be she didn't know--why is that?).  Instead, I got a call from Samsung a week later saying that the servicecompany had miraculously received the part and they wanted to schedule a service call.  I told her I had been put in for an exchange and she insisted that I again deal with this disreputable service company.  I refused, and since I didn't have the Transaction # she said she would call me back today.  She didn't call this morning when she said she would so I called Samsung.

It was fairly inexpensive and looks good in the kitchen.  Observations in no particular order:<br /><br />1. The sensor cooking on this is much better than on our old Sharp countertop unit, which overcooked everything.  I had thought at the time that it would be nice if there was a way to calibrate the sensor.  While the Samsung doesn't give you calibration options, it does let you say what you are cooking, and apparently adjusts its response to the sensor accordingly.  I have found that it works pretty well to always tell it I'm reheating pasta!<br /><br />2. A general-use kitchen timer is provided.  Of course most microwaves do, so that's not unusual, but this one is smarter than some.  It is able to function independently of the cooking timer.  For example, if you are timing something for 30 minutes, then decide partway through you want to heat a cup of water for one minute, it will correctly keep track of the 30 minute timer in the background and display it again after it's done with the water.<br /><br />3. Minor niggle: the oven vent is supposed to come on whenever it detects heat rising from below, but ours seems to always need to be turned on manually.<br /><br />4. This is where the Samsung loses a review star.  The Eco Mode feature is poorly conceived.  When you press the button, the panel lights go out and standby power consumption is reduced.  So far, so good.  But then as as soon as you use the microwave again, or even just open the door, or use the oven light or vent options, it leaves eco mode; the display comes back on and STAYS on.  It really should remember eco as a user preference rather than as a temporary mode.  I also suspect this ties in to the problems some customers have had with the control panel failing.  If we were allowed to set a persistent eco mode, it's likely that the front panel would be mostly-off except when in actual operation, and as a result it might not burn out.  We have made it a habit to push the eco button after each use.<br /><br />In sum, it fits with our kitchen decor and cooks well, and we hope we will be able to make it last a long time by remembering the eco button as often as possible.",10/12/2013,1,1

I really didn't like the way it functioned compared to previous microwaves I have owned. but it looked good, and worked fine; UNTIL YESTERDAY.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, it just went up in flames, it wasn't even in use at the time.<br /><br />The only one in the house was my 72 yr. old mother-in-law, she said she noticed earlier that morning, the display on the microwave was off and she was unable to use it (as if it was unplugged). A while later, the house filled with smoke. Smoke and  flames were shooting out of the top vent of the microwave. She said there was so much smoke she could not even see in the kitchen.  She called 911, the fire dept was dispatched, and she exited our home. By the time they arrived the fire had burned out on its own, and the damage was contained to the internals of the microwave. The fire crew removed the microwave from my home, and inspected the home to insure that the microwave was indeed the cause of the fire. Thankfully there was no damage to our home other than the microwave itself, and a strong odor of smoke and burnt plastic (I'm sure it will take weeks to get rid of the smell).<br /><br />I contacted Samsung, to report what happened and am awaiting a response from the Executive Customer Relations dept. do to the nature of the incident.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what I want from them, more than anything to create awareness. Maybe they will issue a recall, based on this and all of the negative reviews I have read here on Amazon. I would encourage others having problems with this model to report it to Samsung. It may not do you much good, but who knows, you could save a life or something.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/31/2014:<br />Samsung Executive Customer Relations department contacted me on 01/20/2014 (MLK Holiday), by telephone (cell phone). I was asked to provide the microwave serial number but did not have it with me, so we agreed that I would provide it via email. A short time later I received an email asking to provide the serial number as Samsung would like to locate a service center to diagnose the unit.  I responded later that day with the serial number.<br /><br />On 01/21/2014 I received a response which stated, based on the serial number provided, the microwave is out of warranty, but due to the nature of the problem Samsung will cover the cost of diagnostics, and a service center will contacting me.<br /><br />On 01/22/2014 I received a call from the service center informing me they received the service order from Samsung, but it states the microwave is out of warranty so I will be responsible for the payment, I asked them to double check with Samsung, but they said I would have to contact them. I sent an email explaining what the service center said, and a few hours later Samsung responded with a One time Accommodation for the labor which I assume was also sent to the service center.<br /><br />A few days later the service center contacted me again, explaining they received the accommodation from Samsung, and asked if I could deliver the microwave to them, which I agreed (they were only about 1 mile from my home).<br /><br />On 01/29/14 the service center contacted me to explain that several parts in the microwave short circuited, and required replacement.  They explained that the accommodation was for diagnostic labor only, and any further repair would be my responsibility.  They asked for direction; explaining that the parts required are expensive, and the repair would most likely exceed the cost of replacement.<br /><br />I sent another email to Samsung explaining the call from the service center.  I explained that I made it a point to buy appliances from well know major brands such as Samsung with the expectation of higher quality and long life.  I asked that given the fact the unit failed due to a short circuit, after such a short life, under normal residential use, that they consider replacing the microwave at no cost, despite the fact the warranty period had ended.

It came in promptly. I found that it was bent on the bottom, bent on a piece of stainless steel across the front and the vent damper that came inside the oven was damaged. This appeared to be a factory sealed unit. <br />It had to come from the factory like this. Possible the bottom was bent somewhere in shipment ranging from the factory to the shipper. Since I got it on Friday, I went ahead an installed it thinking that Sharp would simply send me the parts as they were screw on simple replacement parts. I was wrong. First Sharp said they did not warrant cosmetic damage. I told them it was factory shipped that way, please send parts. They said NO! Ship it back to who I bought it from. I, after much argument, had to take it down and send it back. This ended up costing the seller shipping charges which they paid. I felt this was not right as Sharp could have easily fixed the problem. The shipper did not have another unit in stock, so I got a refund and ended up buying another brand locally. The foam in bottom of carton was very thin (none in middle), thus, subjecting the unit to shipping damage. I had a Sharp before this one that never gave any real problems, but their customer service really sucks!  <br /> <br />My advise to you is to carefully check ANY microwave oven you buy before you leave the store or install it.

The microwave stopped working altogether in June 2015. If you find this model anywhere online I advise you DO NOT BUY IT....<br /><br />Full disclosure - I usually make my purchases from Amazon but I had a coupon for 15% off any item at PC Richards (a local store) and was fooled into buying this when it was recommended to me by a salesman. I've owned it for just over 2 years now. Most problems started immediately. I will never buy another GE microwave for this reason, and I'm considering never buying any GE product - anything that takes electricity to run must be made much better for safety reasons, and this is one of the worse electronic appliances I've ever purchased.<br /><br />PROS: none that I know of. No wonder it's discontinued.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />&#62; Very soon after the warranty ended we started smelling burnt plastic whenever it was used for any length of time, at any power level. The smell lingers and gets into your food.<br /><br />&#62; When cooking anything, a baked potato for example, the moisture from the food gets trapped inside the oven an pours out when you open the door. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the microwave are dripping wet and must be dried after each use unless you want to end up with a muggy mungy moldy mess after a few weeks. And no, the vent is not blocked on the outside. On the inside, maybe, but that would be a defect the consumer cannot see or fix.<br /><br />&#62; Door open button is very flimsy.<br /><br />&#62; Light stays on when you close the door (when you're done) if you are not careful. You must make sure door closes completely - even if it looks closed it might not be and if the lights are on in the kitchen you might not notice the interior light of the microwave is still on - this can make it over heat (I came back hours later and the inside of the oven was very warm) and may blow out the bulb, which normally lasts the lifetime of the oven.<br /><br />&#62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom. This means venting can be difficult if you have something sitting next to it on the left side. See my photo.<br /><br />&#62; All buttons are hard to push, which is not good for those with disability or arthritis.<br /><br />&#62; The clock timer (the one used when not cooking) is tricky to stop - you must read the manual to figure it out because you can't use common sense for this one; manual says you must press timer button and hold for at least 3 seconds to stop this timer.<br /><br />&#62; If you make a mistake when using the cooking timer you can easily add more time to cooking than you planned. For example, I pressed 14 minutes but wanted to change it to 12, so I tried to clear it and thought I did, but when the 12 minutes of cooking time was done it started again on its own for another 14 minutes. There was nothing to warn me this would happen and I could find nothing in the manual that explains it.<br /><br />&#62; No minute button, only 30 second increments.<br /><br />&#62; Turntable moves out of place very easily, like when you place an item on it or remove something from inside the microwave.

Upon receipt of this item I had no idea that it had concealed damage.  Two days after receipt I elected to install the unit.  I noticed that the bottom corner of the door had a nice dent, but was something that I could live with, rather then deal with the agony of a return.  After installing the unit the door would not stay closed.  After looking the door over, I noticed that the clips where broken that hold it closed.  Totally frustrated at this point.  I have received a return mailing label and MRA number, but this will cost me $50 to ship back.  The unit was not shipped in no box, just corner molding, foam end caps, and shrink wrap &#34;No Original Packaging&#34;.  When it was all said and done, I bought the identical microwave under the Kenmore label from Sears for $100 less.  Multiple emails to Amazon on the return freight with no response.  This was a headache that I really didn't need.  I have purchased numerous items from Amazon in the past with no problems.

(The preheat setting is problematic to say the least),"I picked this unit up primarily for the Convection Oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility. That said, the unit is not without issues.<br /><br />The short story is: the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit. The grill function is great - provided you use the pan that comes with the unit. The convection function is wonderful but never and I mean never use parchment paper in the unit. (FIRE!) The preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off, especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting. The unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built. The two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made.<br /><br />Now for those who are interested, the long story:<br /><br />Microwave:<br /><br />Works just great, seemed to have more power than my built in unit so I did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit. The kids and I have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit.<br /><br />Grill:<br /><br />Love this feature, I made the following - Grilled Cheese (upper rack and pan - 7 minutes with flip at half way point) turned out beautifully. Open face bagel with cheese (upper rack and pan - 5 minutes) grilled to perfection.<br /><br />Convection Oven:<br /><br />I had pretty good but not perfect results here: Baked Russet Potatoes (medium) were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting, my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting. Sweet Potato Fries were kind of a disappointment as well, they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven. Chicken Breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but I did note that Ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result. French bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper - the paper caught fire. I checked the manual about using parchment paper - I use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking - and there was no warning about using it - but I can tell you it is a big no-no.<br /><br />Preheat Function:<br /><br />Well, this function is pretty worthless on my unit. I have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks I have had the unit. The first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire, the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up. The next time we used it, it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down. (It completely turns off, including the time display and will not work at all.) The next time I let it cycle through (both the preheat and 10 minute cycle), the unit remained functional and I was able to convection bake afterwards. Then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook - the unit shut down again. As I said, we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done. Even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey, sometimes the unit remains functional, sometimes it shuts down. The hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in use.<br /><br />Slim Fry:<br /><br />We have not tried this function yet but I will update when we do, perhaps this is the answer to my issues with oven fries!<br /><br />Overall, this is a better multifunction machine than I thought it would be. I was highly skeptical of the convection oven side of the equation as my prior experiences with these sort of units (toaster oven/convection oven) have lead me to conclude that they are okay at best. The oven on this unit really does a decent job with some finagling on the temperature side. (Ignore the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs. regular oven on this unit and you should be fine.)  For the price the unit seems a solid investment, my only reservation being the preheat function which I think I will just chose to not use going forward.<br /><br />Recommended with above reservations.",1/16/2015,1,1

So on that score, it does really well - this really is a great-looking microwave that fits in an upper cabinet and looks custom.  Unfortunately, one month after I purchased it, the trim on the right side of the microwave around the door button started falling off - and it was easy to see why as it was attached only with two-sided tape.  I called up Mabe Canada customer support and after describing the problem and faxing in my receipt, they shipped a replacement microwave straight to my door within 3 business days.

It works great and it looks beautiful. I actually purchased mine online from walmart, but I order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you. I've had mine almost 2 months now. It has a 3 prong grounding plug. It's 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave, so I'm still getting use to that. I'm going to try and address everything I see people asking questions about. First off, when you hit a number, for example 2, it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes. You can press the start button and add 30 seconds. If you want a specific time, for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds, you can press the power button, then the numbers, 3,4, and 5.  It will start cooking 3 min. 45 secs. It has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn, pizza, dinner plate, defrost, etc. It has a normal hum when running. It has a turntable. The clock is displayed in green. It beeps 5 times, not super loud but loud enough, then stops. The light comes on when you open the door and while cooking. It has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door. I've not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior.The handle pulls easily. It has a nice weight to it. I have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it, so I don't know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not, mine doesn't.  The inside dimensions are 12 in. wide, 12 in. deep, and 8 in. high. The turntable plate is 10 1/2 in.  Plenty of room for most things you microwave. For the outside dimensions, the width (side to side) is 19 in., the height is 11 1/2 in. The outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle. The actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back. Here's the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it. I have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in. from the wall. I have it sitting 1 1/2 in. from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space. This means I have it 2 1/2 in. total from the wall. It comes out 15 in. from the back of my cabinet. The front legs sit back 2 1/2 in., which means that it is 12 1/2 in. from the back of my cabinet to the front legs. So, if your shelf is 12 1/2 in. deep, the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in. from the back of your shelf. I have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall, so if you don't, you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1/2 in. deep to give you more vent space. I think this covers everything. I think you'll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave.from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet.

Seems like a lot of cost to just replace a microwave. Has anyone found another similarly sized unit? Or had GE fixed the obvious paint defect that is an obvious problem with this model?",11/6/2011,-1,1

In March of 2014 it started having the SE errors and similar to others on this site, would start on its own, night light would go off and on on its own, beep every 15 minutes, etc.<br />I tried all of the YouTube and other suggestions with removing the circuit board, cleaning all the connections. Originally this worked for two weeks, and then the problems restarted. Kept on repeating the process for the next 2 陆 months with the time interval getting shorter and shorter between cleanings.<br />The last time I left the power on when reinstalling the panel and the system worked fine. Oops, forgot to reinstall the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />Reinstalled the panel with the mounting bracket, again with live power and the SE error came on instantly.<br />Repeated the process three times, no errors without the circuit board mounting bracket; SE errors with the Circuit board mounting bracket.<br />With a large magnifying glass, I discovered a very, very small scratch on the ribbon cable between the circuit board and the control panel. This scratch lines up with a very sharp edge on the circuit board mounting bracket and it seemed that through vibration and general use; the ribbon cable was starting the have a direct contact between the embedded wires in the ribbon cable and the sharp edge of the mounting bracket, more than likely causing the strange SE errors.<br />I covered the sharp edge on the mounting bracket with electrician鈥檚 tape, as well as the ribbon cable where it bent around the mounting bracket projection.<br />Then while reinstalling the panel with live power, I tried twisting the panel, hitting it against the edge of the microwave, jiggling all the wires and all sorts of moves to see if the SE error would show up. No errors showed up.<br />The microwave has been working perfectly for two months now. It my case it is most likely that the manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.e manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.",7/28/2014,1,1

If you live in a small apartment, counter space is typically premium real estate and a microwave eats up quite a bit of that space. That was the case in our place. We had our old microwave on top of the refrigerator because we couldn't sacrifice what little counter space we had. That had its own problems because neither one of us is tall so reaching up with a spatula to remove a microwave dish had a few drop events. Not fun.<br /><br />Our old one recently conked out so off I went in search of a small unit. I saw this one and had a Eureka moment. Since it is only about 14 inches wide, I thought it would fit in the corner next to the coffee maker and once set up, it's great. It does take up space but there is now room for the essentials on the counter since this tucks nicely into the corner.<br /><br />The only issue that we had with this unit is that we have the old school laminated counter top in beige in our kitchen and sliding this into the corner resulted in black lines being drawn on the formica from the feet of the microwave.

I brought it home, removed the older microwave this was replacing and installed this new one, myself. (Installation was a bit more difficult than I expected it to be, but this had more to do with the shoddy installation of the unit it was replacing than any flaws in this unit, so I won't count that as a strike against this product.)<br /><br />In the few months that we have been using this unit, there are several things that I've noticed that have made me regret this purchase:<br /><br />1. The glass plate split in two after about two weeks of use. I have no idea why this occured. My wife stuck in a bowl of oatmeal to cook it and after about 30 seconds there was a loud bang and she turned it off to see what had happened. The glass plate was spilt into two pieces, nearly right down the middle. Weird. The replacement part cost me another $30. Not happy about this!<br /><br />2. The venting fan has a flap that opens to the duct inside the wall. The hinge on this flap is very weak and we can hear it flapping about on windy days. This seems very irregular, as the kitchen wall this unit is mounted on is an inside wall, not an exterior wall, and the ductwork goes up through the roof, not to the nearest exterior wall. I really don't think it should do this. The last unit did not do this, and it's a bit irritating to hear this flap rattling and squeaking around on windy days.<br /><br />3. This microwave positively will not cook a good bag of microwave popping corn. What's up with that? Isn't that a basic necessity of EVERY microwave? Put in a bag of popping corn and you either get 25% of it popped with wet, greasy kernels or 75% popped and it's all burned brown and stinky. The first few times I figured my wife was losing her mind and just counldn't figure out the new unit. Well, I have now tried four different brands of popping corn and got the same results with all brands. For a family that really enjoys microwave popping corn, this was a real bummer, and the number one reason I would never recommend this microwave to another person.<br /><br />4. In general terms, this microwave seems underpowered. It claims to have the same wattage cooking power as the model it replaced, but I'm not seeing it. Everything takes longer to cook with this unit. Sure, in microwave terms, you're only talking about 15% longer cook times which equal out to mere seconds or a few more minutes, so it's not a lot of extra time, but it's just worse than I expected. You always kind of assume that the new model will be better than the old, but that just wasn't the case, in this instance.<br /><br />5. OK, this one is just personal preference and not really a problem with the unit. (I probably should have inquired about this feature before purchasing this product.) I prefer microwaves that you just pop food into, press the seconds (or minutes) you want to cook something and then press start. On this unit, you need to press a button marked cook time before you start pressing any numbers. If you press any number at the start, the unit powers up and begins cooking the food by the number of minutes assigned to that number button on the number pad. Some people may be used to this types of microwave. I am not, so I prefer the aforementioned method of cooking food.

The older model worked fine until I melted it with a small kitchen fire (naturally the one time I disconnected the smoke alarm).  The new model arrived quickly.  I got a friend to help install it.  You'll need a friend  -It's too heavy for you to hold it up with one hand while you screw the bolt on with the other.<br /><br />I gave it four stars in my initial review but I'm changing it to one star because after only a couple of months, the microwave's fan and interior lights would go on sometimes when I closed the oven door.  But if I opened and gently closed the door again, it'd turn off.  It's been about six months since I first installed this oven and this problem is becoming frequent.  Today, my son texts me from home that the microwave won't turn off no matter what he does so I told him to leave the door open and when I get home tonight, I will disconnect it so it doesn't burn the house down.  A microwave oven is supposed to make our lives more convenient,  not fill us with dread that it can start an electric fire.  Checking on the internet, it seems that this is not an uncommon problem.  It's probably not going to be covered by warranty.  And how do I get it to the manufacturer?  They aren't going to pay a repairman to make a housecall for a lousy microwave oven.  If I pay for shpping both ways, I might as well buy a new microwave.  Lessons learned:  I will buy appliances from a brick and mortar store whose return/service policy I understand and I will not use an over-the-range microwave again.",4/7/2015,-1,1

It's often (50+ times) sounded as if it was working, but when I realized it had been an awfully long time without it chiming, I found that it had frozen just a few seconds into the heating. The most disturbing problem was that it has on perhaps five occasions turned on on its own--with no one in the room. There have been many occasions where it has just not worked at all. When this happened, unplugging it and plugging it back in used to reset it so that it would work.

However, I was not looking forward to giving up the multiple functions offered by my larger, over-the-stove microwave.  Additionally, I did not want to give up my useable counter space which I would have to do with the standard 18 inch or more deep countertop microwaves.  I also wanted enough space left on the counter so that, if necessary, when removing something from the microwave, I could sit the container on the counter immediately in front of the microwave.  I had a small 24 inch wide by 14 inch deep nook available between my refrigerator and the corner appliance garage, but was certain I would not find a suitable microwave to fit.  Since we were not replacing cabinets, I had to work with the available spaces.<br /><br />To my surprise, the GE Profile Spacemaker II was the exact size of the nook!  Although there were many negative reviews of the product, I decided to take a chance on this microwave and purchased one at Best Buy.  Through an abundance of caution, I also purchased an additional 4 year warranty so that if I experience any of the problems others have encountered, I will be able to have the Spacemaker II repaired or replaced.  As the extended warranty was only a little more than a service call would cost, I felt it was worth the expenditure.<br /><br />So far, I am very pleased with the GE Profile Spacemaker II microwave.  My spouse and I do not cook meals in our microwave, but do reheat beverages; cook frozen vegetables and veggie burgers; and, occasionally, defrost meat.  The Spacemaker performs these functions admirably!  Although it takes about 30% more time to heat/cook things than my 1100 watt microwave, this has not been a problem.  Further, I like this model better for defrosting as it does not start cooking the meat like the more powerful models do.  The control panel buttons are very responsive.  I have cracked other microwave's button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.<br /><br />In the past, I have allowed bread to raise inside my microwave.  I found this allowed me to leave the bowl or pan uncovered as there is no air flow inside the microwave, and the temperature remains consistent.  The Spacemaker's interior is large enough for me to continue using the microwave in which to raise bread.<br /><br />Because I keep this microwave on my counter, I keep a plastic glass of water in it to prevent accidentally starting it empty and possibly ruining the magnatron.<br /><br />Further, I would caution those who are looking for a compact microwave for an elderly individual who may be confused by having to choose among multiple function buttons.  The GE Profile Spacemaker II has a control panel that can be confusing as it has 29 separate buttons from which to choose.  Thus, it might not be the best choice for individuals.<br /><br />For me, the GE Profile Spacemaker II is the ideal microwave and I am giving it a five-star rating.

I use a microwave to heat leftovers, cook frozen meals, make popcorn, melt butter or cheese, thaw frozen meat, reheat cold coffee, freshen stale bread of make it into croutons, cook sausages and hot dogs etc. I use this microwave several times per day.  I think my microwave usage is pretty typical.  The only thing I don't do in the microwave is prepare entrees from scratch (like cooking a roast or casserole). I've cooked all sizes of frozen entrees with no issues. Note, my review refers to an earlier model of this machine, which seems identical to this one that has replaced it.<br /><br />(1) Form factor. Because the guts of the machine are under the cooking chamber, this has the smallest possible footprint.  And because of the rounded back, I have it tucked into a corner of the countertop. This means I lose only 1' of countertop, and furthermore it's an awkward part of the countertop I wouldn't use for prep work etc because my elbow would bang into the fridge. Every other microwave I've ever owned took up 2' of prime, useable countertop. This makes such a huge difference in the usability and appearance of the kitchen that I'd give it five stars for this reason alone.<br /><br />The interior size of this machine is bigger than you'd think because it's round and all the space is useable. The round turntable entirely fills the rounded shape of the interior. An advantage of this is that nothing falls off into the corners as it cooks. I've occasionally thawed something bigger then the turntable (the sides and front of the microwave are square so this is possible) and it wasn't a problem.<br /><br />(2) Controls. I love love love the simplicity of the controls. It does exactly everything I need it to do in a way that is completely intuitive and simple. I should mention I own an Emerson microwave in my office that I have never yet beenable to figure out how to operate (and I'm of at least normal intelligence). The hated Emerson has lots of buttons and I'm sure it does a lot of things I don't need, but none of that matters because I'm not willing to learn a complex and counterintuitive interface to cook a frozen lunch entree. This Whirlpool, however, is amazing.  It has Power, Defrost, Reheat and Popcorn buttons, as well as a Plus (+) and Minus (-) and a Start and a Stop. I accomplish everything with the Plus, Minus. Start and Stop, and occasionally Power.<br /><br />To operate, you can just press the Plus until you reach the time you want, then press Start. Bam. You can't get any easier than that. The time increments get larger as you increase time, and this is absolutely not a problem. It uses 5 second increments up to 2 minutes, then 15 second increments to 3 minutes, then 30 second increments up to six minutes, then one minute increments from there. This is fine; I've never had an issue where using 6 or 7 minutes instead of 6.5 minutes caused a meal to fail (my pot pies call for 6.5 minutes at 50% power, and they're fine at either 6 or 7.  When I make popcorn, I always listen to the popping and stop it when it slows. That's because popping times depend much more on the freshness and moisture content of the kernels than the power of the microwave; this is true of every microwave. Similarly, when I'm thawing something I pay attention to the progress of it because again, the fat content of the food and how hard it's frozen makes all the difference in timing. I suspect there are fancy convention microwaves with thermal probes that allow completely mindless use, but that kind of ultra high-end microwave isn't what I want or need.<br /><br />I've been using an earlier model of this microwave for three years with absolutely no problem. I can't speak to specific reliability of the model here, but mine is the same in layout of controls, form factor, etc, so I would not hesitate to buy this one. In factI'm very tempted to buy one of these for the office and get rid of that annoying Emerson once and for all.",12/14/2014,-1,1

It heats food quickly, is easy to use (once you review the manual), and can serve the same functions a microwave and toaster oven do.<br /><br />What makes this microwave different...<br />+ It has many possibilities.<br />+ Pizza is crispy on the bottom (when reheated) even on the microwave setting!<br />+ It can be simple, or you can dive into all the stuff it can do!<br />+ The size is comparable to our old 1.1 cu ft microwave, yet it can do more.<br />+ The colors are awesome!  The stainless is only on the front (which makes for less to clean) and the gray top and sides are not stainless---so they will keep cleaner.<br />+ The dials and quick microwave settings are smart.  To reheat something for 30 seconds, just press the button on the bottom right (once for 30 seconds, twice for a minute, etc.).  Or, press the microwave button, turn the dial to the time you'd like (backwards or forwards) and then press the start button.<br />+ The clock setting is easy to set.<br />+ The convection oven works for settings up to 400 degrees.  Preheat the oven first, and then select the convection oven.  You'll need to read the directions in the manual first, but then it's easy to navigate from there on out.<br />+ The oven includes a crispy plate, two wire racks (that worked great on the convection setting), a glass plate and ring.  I baked some cheese onto the plate while using the convection setting and it cleaned up super easy.<br /><br />What may concern you...<br />-  The microwave does need to be on a sufficiently powered circuit (not on a power cord).  It does not have a long cord, so you need to be able to place it right in front of the outlet you are going to use or close to it.<br />-  Don't use plastic plates that are not microwave safe.  One review for this microwave was mistaken--they said you couldn't use plastic in it.  Not true.  You just have to use microwave safe materials.  There's a thorough and easy to reference list in the manual (which is located inside the microwave oven when you unpack it).<br />- The oven does have a heating element on the top because it is a convection oven, so you will want to make sure you have a microwave safe plastic cover that you can use when you are microwaving.  Otherwise, it's going to be a pain to clean it up.<br /><br />Other matters to address...<br />It's always interesting to read other people's reviews.  One reviewer didn't like the manual, because a cookbook wasn't included.  Honestly, I've gotten so many cookbooks over the years with appliances and I've never used them.  The manual for this oven seems small, but it is packed with all the essential information you'll need to use it--and more.  No recipes, but all the guidelines for cooking vegetables, reheating foods, etc.  I don't cook in my microwave oven normally.  I did bake spinach artichoke dip in this oven, though, on 375 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly!<br /><br />Another reviewer lamented the lack of a timer on this microwave oven.  That's not true actually.  If you use the microwave function, the time counts down normally.  If you use the convection setting, you have to select how long you want the oven to cook for and then it will turn off automatically when it is done.  If you find you need a few extra minutes, it's very easy to turn it right back on.  To use the convection oven, you do need to preheat the oven first, but that's not a problem.  One feature that was awesome was that when I took my dish out of the oven to stir it, the oven did not start cooking again until I pressed the start button (so the time didn't keep going either).  Most people I know use the timers on their ovens or use a stand alone timer that they can take with them into another room if needed or move to where they will hear it when it goes off.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with this microwave.  It covers the basics and beyond very well!  I don't expect it to do everything--grill, slimfry, microwave, convection.  But, the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me!  Many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all.  I prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove, so I don't want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess.

This model has the real stainless handle, and not the painted-grey handle I saw on a lower end model. We installed it with minimal problems for our kitchen out of the 1960's that usually has non standard things (finding a fridge that fit was very painful). We needed one with a low clearance distance to the cook-top - 14 inches or less, and Samsung meets the bill at 13 inches. After using a counter-top microwave for the past few years, this seems huge. I'm still learning all the features, but am certainly pleased by the power of the fan. I'm exploring the use of the sensor cooking and can't wait to use the rack to be able to actually cook the amount of squash I want at once - the old microwave was just too small.

Like others, I purchased this unit based on the recommendation in Consumer Reports; this recommendation didn't pan out.  I tried to schedule warranty service and GE is making us wait a week to schedule and their frustrating telephone system does not provide information on where I can take it for service for faster turnaround (and didn't put me in touch with a live representative).    When the microwave oven worked, it worked fine.  We replaced a Sharp unit with this one; though this unit has the advantage of a larger capacity, its controls are less intuitive.    Based on poor reliability and poor service, we're certainly not going to buy another GE microwave.  We've had good success with GE refrigerators in the past; this is very disappointing.  A quick search on the web now reveals that GE microwave ovens are not reliable--many others appear to have similar problems with the magnetrons.

After verifying at least 3 times that this would cover all expenses incurred, I gave her my credit card # and she transferred me to what was to be the service appointment scheduling extension; actually, it was the extended warranty department, who told me that this $285 contract did not cover handles, knobs, etc...one hour later (was I frustrated by this or what???) still on the phone, having been transferred at least 6 times (each person I spoke with had the same message...I apologize).

My LG microwave suddenly stopped working and I am ashamed to say that the majority of my cooking is done in the microwave - TV dinners, oatmeal, popcorn etc. so I wanted to buy and take home my purchase immediately. After shopping at Home Depot, Lowes and Costco I found that none of these retailers kept over the range microwaves in stock. The same proved to be the situation at Best Buy except they had this Whirlpool microwave that had been returned because of shipping damage and was available for immediate sale and for $100.00 off its $249.99 regular price because of a large dent on the left rear that cannot be seen after installation. I had read reviews and intended to buy a Samsung unit but, I did not want to wait 3 days for delivery and for $150.00 I figured it was worth the risk. The installation went well, I found the instructions and templates provided good information on the installation procedure. I was able to install this microwave by myself. The LG unit I was replacing came with the home so I don't know how old it was (other than I bought my home 1-1/2 years ago) and it was considerable heavier than the Whirlpool unit. The door on the Whirlpool unit opens and closes better than the LG unit, it is extremely easy to operate and has been functioning flawlessly for the 2 weeks I've had it installed. I have never been a fan of Whirlpool dating back many years ago to a Whirlpool washing machine I had owned, bad memories last a long time.

If I could give half-stars, I would give the LG a 4.5 at this point. It was very reasonably priced compared to others with similar features, and reasonably easy to install.  It does a good job overall, has some features that the Spacemaker did not have, but also lacks some nice features that the (much more expensive) Spacemaker had.    Here's what I really like about the LG:  1. Multiple speed exhaust fan with timer.  2. More time/Less time buttons.  3. Soften/Melt/Defrost settings work well.  4. Turntable on/off setting is useful for large or oblong cooking vessels.  5. Popcorn, hot dog settings are very accurate.  6. Hold Warm feature keeps cooked items at a safe temp for up to 90 minutes.  7. It doesn't need the clock set just to use the microwave, (like the Spacemaker did.)  8. It works reliably every time I use it!    Here's what I feel the LG lacks:  1. Doesn't remind you after cooking is finished (the Spacemaker beeped discreetly every 30 seconds for up to an hour).  2. Reheat settings are sometimes a bit too aggressive.  3. Can't adjust the volume of the beeps when setting or finishing cooking (default volume is a bit loud).  4. Aesthetically, the black window on the front is not as attractive as the Spacemaker's white window.  5. Although the EZ-ON button starts and adds 30 second increments, a Quick-Minute button would be useful.  6. The turntable is smaller than it could be (although this has not really presented any problems).  7. The Spacemaker had an automatic nightlight feature, the LG does not (this is a small inconvenience).    At this point in its lifetime, I would recommend this microwave.  If that changes, I'll update this review accordingly.",8/8/2011,0,1

This model has a TSB out for peeling door handles (as one other reviewer wrote). However, their review is not for this improved model. If you have an Advantium oven with the peeling door handle don't just order the handle - replace the whole door. It is a new handle design that addresses the problem. My door was replaced under warranty.<br /><br />Bought a new house, miss our oven so much we're having one installed here. If you're considering one remember this:<br /><br />1) You cannot run it as a microwave with the metal tray and/or racks in - it will dramatically shorten its life<br />2) You cannot run it as an oven without the metal tray at least in - it will dramatically shorten its life.<br />3) You cannot soak the control panel down with soapy water to clean it - you can short it out. You clean it simply by wiping with a microfiber cloth. Done.<br /><br />All three of these points are in the owner's manual - which I'm going to speculate a lot of people don't read. When I sold my last house I purposely put the owner's manual around all the racks outside of the oven and wrote a note to the new owner, &#34;do not use until you read.&#34;<br /><br />OK - rant over - here is the goods.<br /><br />This does almost everything.

It combines the microwave and halogen oven at the same time. Because the microwave is used at reduced power, you can use the metal tray (not the racks) for speed cook mode.<br /><br />You can bake two large potatoes, crispy skin on the outside (cooking trick, brush with olive oil for crispy skin and sprinkle with Kosher salt on the outside) in 13 minutes.

You can bake crescent rolls in the can in about 1/2 the time you would in a conventional oven, crispy outside, flaky inside.<br /><br />There are hundreds of pre-programmed cook settings for a wide range of food items and dishes. Whether you're using it as a simple microwave to cook bacon, or you're using the speed cook function to roast meat. Yes, you can even roast in it.<br /><br />The capacity for a microwave is huge, at 1.7 cubic feet, and if you're a family of 2 or 3, you'll probably find yourself using this for most of your baking needs.

Thats something I'll be talking to them about after the service tech comes out.<br /><br />Note Added 16/3/14:  I also reviewed microwave on Lowes.com last week but it was not published. Presumably they delete any negative reviews.  Will never trust that site again, after all, it was the positive reviews on that site that made me buy the thing in the first place.<br /><br />Update 17/3/14:  Service Tech came out and said it was the fan cover that caught fire.  The second one he's seen in this area in the past 2 weeks.  Luckily?? we were able to stop the flames before it melted anything but the fan cover itself.  So they are just replacing the fan cover.  Assured me it is a different model though.  They also told me that it happened because we were cooking popcorn (in a microwave popcorn popper) and it was too close to the ceiling.  But, we've used the exact same bowl in 3 different brands of microwaves over the past 10 years without a problem, so I just don't get it.<br />To my dismay, they didn't care about the burn marks on the ceiling of the microwave either.  Sure, it's not a large area, but it's still really noticeable.  Just told me I should be able to get it off with bleach, (which didn't work) or to go out and buy myself some touch up paint.<br />So there you go, up to you if you want to risk buying this model.

Needs a recall, but Whirlpool does not care.","This microwave was selected during a KB HOME build for our new home over 2 years ago (Summer 2010).  The microwave indicated that it was manufactured in April 2010.  Low and behold the microwave would start shutting down by itself when I hit start beginning about June 2012.  A few days ago it just stopped working completely.  No pop, no fizzle, no crackle - it just wouldn't heat up anything.  Whirlpool dispatched a 3rd-party repair person and he stated that the magnetron was bad (or dead?).  He was fairly certain it was a recall item.  The repair person estimated that, absent a recall, it would cost $450 to fix. The service appointment itself was $89.  The following day, the repair service left a voice-mail stating that it was not a recall item, but that I should verify it with Whirlpool .<br /><br />I contacted Whirlpool (1-800-253-1301) and the customer service rep stated that it wasn't their problem once the standard 12-month warranty had elapsed.  The rep said there was no recall for the magnetron.  I escalated the matter to a supervisor.  All the supervisor did was reiterate that Whirlpool wasn't going to do anything past the 12-months.  The supervisor then offered to sell me one of four new microwaves at a VIP rate.  Of course the rate was not VIP at all once you added the deliver ($70) and the installation ($45) charges (so for being screwed over, I was a VIP?).  It goes without saying that I didn't take her up on the offer(s).<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very upset and immediately Google'd the model number in the hope of finding out more info on the problem and perhaps locating a cheaper replacement for the microwave.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up here on Amazon and saw that 29 other reviewers before me also had issues with this particular microwave.  I got a certified lemon.<br /><br />What are my options at this point?  A class action lawsuit?  A complaint to the state Attorney General's office? I don't know. What I do know is that Whirlpool is aware of the problem and could not care less.  I'm out of $600 (or more) and  I'm left reheating stuff in the oven now.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.",11/21/2012,-1,1

No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.

Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works!

Every appliance in our kitchen is new and this particular appliance is my favorite due to the uniqueness and convenience of this model. This microwave has exceeded our expectations in every way. One of the reasons we bought this microwave was that we needed a microwave that would fit under the countertop so our kids could reach it. It is also nice that the door slides open and I can reach down to lift out the food instead of having to reach up at face level and lift food out and down. I liked the unique concept of a drawer that pulls open instead of a door that pops open. I was a little concerned about reviews on earlier models that the auto open and close function on this microwave has a tendency to break. However, it seems that Sharp decided to manufacture this one so it closes with a button or by pushing or pulling on it to eliminate that problem. I was also concerned that it didn't have a piece in it that rotates the food. So, we were surprised to find that none of the food we have cooked has hotspots (note: I only use my microwave for reheating...not cooking). I LOVE this microwave. I had considered purchasing the 30 but decided that it was unlikely that I would need to put a dish in the microwave that was bigger than 24. So far, this has been the perfect size. It is even tall enough that I can put my portable mug in it to heat up my tea. Also, my lovely daughter did not know that you can't put metal in the microwave. She put her fork in with her plate. Surprisingly, the microwave did not arch. We checked the manual and it said you can even use aluminum foil to cover portions of meat. Not sure how they do it, but I'm not likely to try it. The microwave seems fine after the fork episode. This microwave also has programmable features such as softening ice cream. It asks what size of ice cream then sets the time as appropriate. It's a nice feature but I'm not usually softening a whole tub ofice cream. Just a portion of a tub. One other feature I use frequently, pushing the power button after closing the drawer will turn on the microwave in one minute increments. As an example, pushing the button 3 times will equate to 3 minutes. This is a pricey microwave but has been well worth the expense in our experience. I highly recommend this microwave!",10/29/2009,1,1

Anyway shortly after I cleaned it the drawer wouldn't go in or  out.

It works splendidly without any problem with noise or mechanical parts. My experience with Sharp Carousels has been 5 stars.  At home and work they have been dependable, efficient, good looking, and inexpensive.  Both the 2.0 and 1.4 cubic foot Carousels are commodious enough for large casseroles.

I bought Carousels and have used them simultaneously almost daily.  They have been great workhorses.  The smaller one lost some of the digital display to no effect a few months ago, then made nasty little arcing noises last week and promptly was sent out to pasture. Last year I bought new stainless steel appliances (including Bosch dual fuel slide-in range-- the dream machine), and so I chose the stainless steel Sharp R-408LS Carousel 1.4 cubic foot/1100-W with a 14 inch turntable from BJ's ($99) as a replacement. The match with the other appliances was so good that I replaced the 2 cubic foot/1200-W with Sharp's R-520KS microwave as well. The display pads are lightly different, but better than losing size in the 1.4 cu. ft.  The Carousels match the Bosch oven door design remarkably, including the rounded window corners.  My kitchen looks better than when it was totally new with this addition. Knowing that these two new appliances are untried in the long term, I can only say they are 5+ stars as week-old additions to my kitchen. The microwaves do everything I want powerfully and quickly.

It heats well, is (in black) quite attractive, the microwave and fan are quiet, controls are convenient for basic operations.  Cons:  one of the installation templates is printed on the cardboard packaging, the edges of which shred when cut, making the template difficult to use accurately.  The bolts supplied will not work in a deep cabinet and it took trips to four hardware stores to find longer replacements.  The instructions did not include an option to hardwire the electrical connection, so I had to swallow hard and cut the cord without knowing what I'd find once I had (turned out not to be a problem).  I exhausted through the wall, but there's an outlet for internal exhaust, and it opens upwards towards the ceiling.  And I mean OPENS.  There's no grid to keep small objects from falling into the body of the microwave from the cabinet above.  This is atrocious design!  I used some semi-rigid plastic screen and clear silicone sealant to protect this area.

The inverter defrost works almost perfectly every time, never cooking my food more than it should, but the reheat is a gimmick.<br /><br />This is a large countertop microwave, at about 2.2 cubic foot.  Coming from an over-the-range microwave this is a huge improvement in size.  The microwave heats uniformly and fast (it is 1200 watts).  The sensor reheat should only be used on foods it is safe to boil, otherwise it overcooks about everything else.  It also works best when you lightly cover the food, as sometimes uncovered food triggers it to turn off too early.  Lightly covered is critical, as the sensor works off water vapor temperature being released from the product.  If the water vapor cant leave the container it could become superheated.  Sensor cook should also only be used under supervision (you should be in the same room).<br /><br />I have had the microwave for about 6 months now with no issue.  It is no louder than other microwaves I have used, and the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  You do not have to press a cook button or anything to start your timed cooking.  My favorite feature is the inverter defrost.  Remember you enter the weight in pounds, so for an 8 oz pack of bacon you would enter 5 and start for 1/2 of a pound.  If you had a 1.5 pound package of meat, you would enter 15 and start for 1.5 pounds.  The display shows the weight correctly. Not much else to say about the product, it is a microwave after all.<br /><br />Update: To improve sensor reheat performance, use a lid over the food with a vent hole.  I use a paper plate with a small hole (finger tip size) punched in it.  This will make sure the reheat stays running long enough, but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn't over cook.<br /><br />Update (6/26/2010): I have been using the microwave 2 years now.  It has been no issue and still works perfectly.  I use the sensor reheat almost all the time for soups and casseroles, and use the inverter defrost for my frozen goods.  I also use the popcorn button to heat microwave popcorn bags.  Everything has been working great!<br /><br />Update (7/26/2011): Still going strong.  I use the inverter regularly for defrost, or lowering the power level to cook something slower.  It has worked well for me, and I think problems might be from shipping, quality control, or some other factor.<br /><br />Update (3/21/2013): Still going strong, but maybe a bit noisier now.

Then a couple of weeks ago I came into the kitchen and saw the SE error code. I wasn't able to set the clock so I unplugged it and started researching what the error code meant. As you have probably read in other reviews, this is a common Samsung problem. The steam from cooking on the stove underneath the microwave damages the cooking sensor which causes the entire oven to malfunction.

1489,US,51401810,RKXNZX22HQZEE,B00NN136NQ,464779766,"samsung mc11h6033ct countertop convection microwave with 1.1 cu. ft. capacity, slim fry technology, grilling element, ceramic enamel interior, drop down door, and eco mode in stainless steel",Major Appliances,3,182,192,Y,N,Takes your chef skills down a few notches,"I鈥檓 always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device. My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling 鈥?which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called 鈥渙il-less鈥?fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald鈥檚, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I鈥檇 still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I don鈥檛 know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. It鈥檚 part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else. Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave, but with the quirky implements, required-reading manual and the 鈥渨e鈥檒l let you know when it will be done when we鈥檙e ready to let you know鈥?feature, it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars.e even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.)

It is very specifically for counter-top use only and it has an EXTREMELY short cord.  The cord doesn't even reach to the far side of the microwave.  Expect to need an extension cord.  The unit is a tiny bit smaller than average, but not much.  It has a pull down door that doesn't lay flush when opened, which may be a problem for larger dishes, but I've yet to encounter an issue.  There is an internal light that turns on when the unit is operating and when the door is open.  It runs a lot quieter than any microwave I've ever seen, and does so in all four modes (microwave, convection oven, air fryer, and toaster oven/grill).  There is no timer, which I found odd, but I've been using the phone for that for so long, I barely notice.<br /><br />The settings make it super easy to use.  You can auto-reheat a dinner plate or a casserole with a single feature.  There is a convenient popcorn button.

For medium dark toast, I go three minutes on each side.  It comes it shockingly good, same as from any toaster.

Other models require some extra space in front of the microwave on the left side, to be able to open the door. It is not a problem for most kitchens, but if you have a deep cabinet to the left of the microwave that extends in front of oven, Sharp seems like the only option. Sharp has put a smaller door that starts about an inch from the left side of the microwave, so it opens freely.    So far I was not disappointed. I'm mostly using the microwave mode, convectional mode. It cooks well, and the menu is rather intiutive - what else do you need? Auto reheat works well and produces consistently good results. I was not getting very good result with mixed mode (oven + microwave) though.    There are some faults in this model, that I think Sharp should've done better, so it only got 4 starts:  1) The menu system could be better. E.g. the Start button on most microwaves also serves as 'Add minute' or 'Add 30sec', but here it would not do anything - one has to use dedicated 'Add minute' button. I got used to it, but my guests can't easily find this button.  2) The fan is very very loud. It has two speeds, but even with reduced speed, it is very loud. It does not look extremely powerful either.  3) The range light is generated by two small incandescent bulbs. I would expect energy efficient fluorescent lamps or LEDs for this high-end oven. They could've perfectly fit a long tube there, but have instead put old unefficient incandescent bulbs.  4) The interior is stainless steeel, but it is not very smooth, so it takes some effort to clean the microwave.",10/13/2008,1,1

My older and twice as expensive Whirlpool died and I didn't want to spend another 500 bucks on something that I now realize is a disposable item.

Out of 4 separate kitchen appliances, 3 have had problems within 2 to 3 years of ownership.  The GE Cafe microwave suddenly stopped heating and we had to have a repairman come replace the magnetron and diode.  It worked a few weeks but stopped working again.  Then we found out it costs more to repair than to buy a new one.  We traced a workaround to the problem ourselves and found that the microwave works as long as we turn on the stove exhaust fan.  So now, every time we use our microwave, you need to turn on the exhaust fan.  Nice!  Numerous other reviews have complained about the keypad burning out as well, so if you buy, make sure to buy a long term multi-year warranty.  Our GE failures happened shortly after the 1 year warranty expired, and parts/labor for most repairs adds up to the purchase of a new appliance.",7/6/2013,-1,1

I selected it mainly due to the price (less than 60 bucks at walmart) and the fact that it takes up little counter space. Although I was not expecting much in terms of features, I've been really impressed with this.<br /><br />It offers a wide range of programming features. There are 6 one-touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press. It also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start-up or while the microwave is already running. There are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting.<br /><br />It looks really nice - much better than I was expecting. Pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle, and a black casing. Looks like it cost a lot more. Easy to clean, and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front. One difference from the picture -- the key pad is all black, and not white and black as in the photo.<br /><br />The 0.9 capacity is just right. I also have a 0.7 capacity machine, but that has a problem with any dish that's larger than 11 inches. The 0.9 gives you a decent amount of interior space, but doesn't take up much more counter space than the 0.7.<br /><br />It has 900 watts of power, and does a good job of heating foods quickly. The interior light is bright and comes on when the unit is running or the door is open. Reasonably quiet when it is running - typical noise level for a microwave.<br /><br />Can't speak to reliability as of yet, but it comes with a 12 month warranty that is extended to 18 months if you register it online.<br /><br />Great machine if you're looking for something that is small, but still very usable.

It would actually run, just would not heat the food.<br /><br />From extensive research, I figured out which components, when broken, would allow my microwave to run but just not heat.  The list below is from the most likely to least likely cause of the problem.<br /><br />1. Diode<br />2. Magnetron  [many times #1 & #2 happen together]<br />3. Capacitor<br />4. High Voltage Regulator<br />5. Control circuit board<br /><br />90%+ of the time it is #1 or #2 and most likely both.<br /><br />For me, it was both.<br /><br />When I ordered the above diode I tested it with an Ohm [volt] meter and a 9v batter.  The original had current both ways.  The new one allowed current only one way - that's the correct result.<br /><br />Tests on my old and new magnetrons with the Ohm meter had the same results (no battery needed for this).  Both tests read as a closed circuit (or 0.00 on my Ohm meter).  So I wasn't sure if the original Magnetron was actually broken or not.<br /><br />So to check this, I kept the old Magnetron installed and just installed the new diode (plenty videos on youtube on this).<br /><br />No heat. Problem NOT fixed.<br /><br />So then I replaced the Magnetron and kept the new diode in place. New Magnetron.  New Diode.<br /><br />Success.....my microwave works.

We immediately noticed that from that point on the microwave would not heat food unless the vent fan was running.

There aren't that many drawer microwaves available.  Why buy a drawer microwave?  Well, the most important reason is that my wife wanted one in our new house!  Her arguments were as follows:  1) no need to lift or inspect foods over her head, 2) made space for a vent. While microwaves can generally be vented from the front or the above (top), our new house didn't have any vent.  So, all cooking fumes were vented into the room.  With this oven, we removed the cabinet above the existing microwave and installed a stainless steel vent hood (above the range).  Still, not perfectly ventalated.  I had to modify a base cabinet near the stove to accept the drawer microwave.  Not a problem for me as I am a woodworker, but a problem or extra costs for others.  In addition, I had to add an electrical outlet.  Not a problem for me as I am a retired electrical engineer, but maybe a cost for others.  After the installation, simple enough, the drawer didn't want to stay closed.  That is, you push the close button and the drawer closed but re-opened immediately.  I was about to call for service but I did the following:  push the drawer closed manually, that is by hand.  This seemed to work and then the automatic closure mechanism started working okay.  So, no service call required.  The only shortcomings I see are that the power is not as great as our prior microwave and that there isn't a rotating table.  Dispite this, we are happy with this model so far after about a year.  Shorter people may like this oven a lot, and, it is REALLY COOL!  So, I would recommend this oven.",2/26/2012,1,1

How much do GE techs charge per hour? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say. How long will it take to complete the job? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say.   Let's estimate that the labor involved takes half an hour to pull the cover off and dismantle the thing enough to get to the bulb and replace it.

We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.

A lot of the reviews I have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges. Samsung (or whoever the Samsung dealer on here is) has only added to the confusion, unfortunately.<br /><br />First, a few points to set the record straight. The appliance is NOT covered in stainless steel. There may be a bit of it in the trim, but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn't actually sen one in person. Most of the outside has a black, textured metal finish, which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances. It may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though.<br /><br />There is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction, which is limited to the trim, &#34;open button&#34; and part of the door latch. I have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance. In fact, the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside. Some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode, which is not true. The rack can be used in the combination grill/microwave mode just fine and your microwave will NOT burst into flames. From the manual, page 11: &#34;Grill Rack, to be placed on the turntable. The metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking&#34;. It will even &#34;work&#34; in the microwave-only setting, although it won't contribute to the cooking process at all. In fact, the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave AND grill at the same time, and you can't utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place.<br /><br />This brings me to the main point of my review. Those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave. This is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison. Is it heavier than most stand-alone microwaves? Of course it is, because it has an entirely separate heating element, electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior. This is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta, pizza, crusts, etc. The additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than stand-alone microwaves, which is entirely understandable to me. This also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavy-duty microwaves. If used with the grill though, it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating.<br /><br />Adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of stand-alone microwaves on the market. The reason for this is pretty simple. To keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance. Without the heavy-duty (which is necessarily heavy) inside and outside finishes the device has, it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned. For those who wonder why it doesn't have more capacity or more wattage, the reasons all boil down to safety. You can only add so much shielding to keep the size (and cost) of such an appliance practical. I think that Samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety, size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does.<br /><br />In regards to cost, I have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks. At one point I believe it was $179 (shipping included). Then it went up to $230 (shipping NOT included). Today, it is down to $199.99 with free shipping. I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is, but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries, it seems like at bargain to me.<br /><br />For me personally, this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things. The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen, ever. It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone, actually. All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though, because it is definitely more expensive than a stand-alone microwave. If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill. I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though. I am too spoiled with this product's cooking ability at this point. In any event, I think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here.
